0,The Hindu,Why increasing AC coaches and reducing Sleeper and Second ...,https://www.thehindu.com/data/why-increasing-ac-coaches-and-reducing-sleeper-and-second-class-a-problem-for-commuters-data/article67562053.ece,,"November 24, 2023 09:30 am | Updated 09:30 am IST

For some time now, the Indian Railways has been introducing AC coaches in trains by replacing either Sleeper or Second-Class coaches. In May, in four pairs of trains operating out of Mangaluru Central Railway Station, one Sleeper Coach each was replaced by an AC 3-tier Economy Class coach each. In September, in Bagmati Superfast Express, Rapti Sagar Superfast Express and Muzaffarpur Express, an AC 3-tier Economy Class coach was introduced in place of a general Second Class coach each.

These changes have serious implications as the probability of travellers reserving a ticket in Sleeper and Second Classes has come down, forcing them to either upgrade to AC coaches or make alternative travel plans. Those holding an unreserved ticket to travel in General Coaches also may find it tough to get seats. With a relatively smaller share of people able to afford the higher costs of AC coaches, and in scenarios where alternative arrangements are not possible, incidents of general ticket holders invading reserved compartments have become common.

A comparison of passengers carried in 2019-20 and a decade back in 2009-10, shows that the above examples are not exceptions but the norm.

Table 1 | The table shows the % share of passengers carried by various classes of service — AC, Sleeper and Second in 2019-20 and 2009-10. The table also shows the difference (in % points) in the share of passengers between these two time periods.

For instance, in 2019-20, of all passengers carried by Indian Railways (including both reserved and unreserved), 7.8% were in the AC coaches, a sharp jump from 3.6% a decade back — an increase of 4.2 percentage points. The share of those who travelled in the Second Class reduced from 85.3% to 76.5% — a decrease of 8.7 percentage points.

The table also looks at the same data for only passengers who made a reservation. As the total row shows, the share of reserved passengers carried by AC coaches increased by 9.8% points while that of Sleeper Class decreased by 2.8% points and that of Second Class decreased by 6.6% points in the decade considered.

A zone-wise comparison shows that the share of AC seats rose sharply in the Central, Northern and Western Railways, while the rise in Southern and Eastern Railways was not that steep. When both reserved and unreserved passengers are considered, in the Central, Northern and Western Railways, the share of AC seats increased by over 5% points, while Second Class’ share decreased by about 10% points or more.

Table 2 | The table shows the average rate (in paise) charged per passenger per kilometre across various classes of travel in Indian Railways in 2019-20. The table also shows the difference in average rate (in paise) when compared to 2009-10.

There is an 80 paise difference per passenger per kilometre between AC 3-tier coaches and reserved Sleeper Class in 2019-20. Moreover, the fare of AC 3-tier has increased by 33 paise per passenger per kilometre in the past decade, while that of reserved Sleeper Class increased only by 17.4 paise, validating the affordability concerns of travellers.

These changes were mandated due to the poor operating ratio of the Indian Railways — which worsened after the pandemic. Before the pandemic Indian Railways on average used to spend ₹98 to earn ₹100. In 2021-22, it spent ₹107 to earn every ₹100.

In the tables, AC class includes AC First tier, AC 2-tier, AC 3-tier and AC Chair Car. Sleeper and Second Classes include coaches in both Ordinary and Mail trains. Only non-suburban trains were considered for this analysis. And only seven Railway zones which have sufficient data were considered.

1,The Hindu,Wilhelmsen Ship Management expands India office by adding two ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wilhelmsen-ship-management-expands-india-office-by-adding-two-new-functions-to-hire-more/article67566454.ece,,"November 23, 2023 09:09 pm | Updated November 24, 2023 07:14 pm IST - MUMBAI

Wilhelmsen Ship Management (WSM), one of the world’s largest third-party ship managers with a portfolio of more than 450 vessels and 11,000 active seafarers, has announced the expansion of its Indian operations with the introduction of two new functions and increasing the intake of cadets from India and employees in its India office.

Currently Wilhelmsen employs around 3,000 Indian seafarers, constituting nearly 30% of its total global seafarers’ pool. It also has 120 shore-based employees in India. This number is expected to grow by 10% and 25%, respectively, by the end of next year, a top executive said.

“We aim to increase our headcount and establish India as a strategic hub to support our global operations and growth plans.” said Carl Schou, CEO & President, Wilhelmsen Ship Management in an interview.

“We have started two new functions which include Vessel Accounting for ship owners and Ship Inspection Service for buyers and sellers of ships. Now India would be the hub of these two functions and we are adding resources for this,” Mr. Schou said.

He said this expansion was fueled by the growth of the fleet under its management and India’s position as a priority for the company. He also said the company would explore how it could benefit from the facilities being made available at the GIFT City in Gujarat.

Now the key functions performed from the India office include Marine Personnel, Maritime Training, Global Procurement, GSHEQ - Ship Security, Ship Inspection, Vessel Accounting Services and Planned Maintenance Systems.

“India is an important market for us producing some of our finest seafarers. The nation’s education standards produce competent seafarers that have contributed to our success in the gas tanker and car carrier segments.”

The company on Thursday celebrated the Silver Jubilee of its International Maritime Training Centre (IMTC) in Mumbai which has played a crucial role in training Indian seafarers for the challenges of operating technologically advanced ships.

With over 81,000 participants and 6,900 trade tests conducted, IMTC offers a variety of internationally certified courses, including DGS-approved courses.

On the occasion, IMTC introduced it’s first interactive virtual reality training hub that would provide learning experiences that combines emotion and technology.

“This concept will be driven from India and will be replicated to all manning offices network worldwide,” the CEO said.

IMTC will be positioned to be a global training content provider producing quality training content and enhanced learning experience to all Wilhelmsen seafarers globally through e-learning platforms and virtual reality training hub. He said the company is strategically preparing for the 2030 landscape and based on the projection 70% of the world fleet would use conventional fuel, while 20% will run on LNG, and the balance 10% using alternative fuels.

“Leveraging digital systems, we are implementing data-driven strategies and KPIs to reduce fuel consumption. Our investment in training equips our crew members to take emission-conscious initiatives,” he added.

“Through integrating technology, data insights and skilled personnel, we are positioning our operations to support ship owners’ vision for a net zero emission future” Mr. Schou said.

In an industry traditionally dominated by males, the company is now focusing on hiring more women officers and cadets to promote gender diversity.

Currently, female cadets constitute 4% of its yearly intake and the objective is to increase the ratio to 10%. The company recently promoted two female captains since last year and said it would increase the number of women cadets from India year-on-year."

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh on November 23 wrote a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar demanding ban on the production, storage, distribution and sale of food products labelled ‘halal’ in the State.

He made the demand on the lines of Uttar Pradesh government which has banned eatables such as dairy products, sugar, bakery items, peppermint oil, savouries and edible oil labelling halal.

Mr. Giriraj Singh said that action should be taken against the ‘destructive forces’ in Bihar the way Uttar Pradesh did. In the letter, he has written that ‘halal’ business of ‘namkeen’, dry fruits, sweets, medicines was going on whereas the certification related to such items was only done by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. He alleged that companies manufacturing these products were given certificates by paying huge amounts of money and there was ‘big conspiracy’ behind such business.

Along with the letter, he also issued a video statement in which he stressed that in secular democracy ‘halal’ business was not only against the Constitution but also ‘treason’. He further linked it to the ‘terrorist activities’.

“The market is being Islamised in the name of ‘halal’ certificates, the way any work is started by chanting mantras in Sanatan, same is being done by the traders of vote by promoting such things. They are part of the ‘tukde-tukde’ gang and INDIA block. The Congress party nourished it for many years. You visit any shop in Bihar, one can find products labelled ‘halal’. It is like the Jizya tax which wants to establish Sharia law. The Chief Minister of Bihar should immediately impose a ban on such products,” Mr. Giriraj Singh said in the video statement.

He also claimed that ‘halal’ products would play a role in dividing society. Mr. Giriraj Singh asserted that ‘halal’ certification all over the world was ₹2 trillion and the link of this form of economy with terrorist activities coming to the light needed to be investigated thoroughly.

“The way Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji has banned the production, storage and distribution of halal products. I, as a resident of Bihar and Lok Sabha member from Begusarai, urge Bihar CM to impose a ban on ‘halal’ products and take action. There should be an investigation of terrorist activities linked to ‘halal,’” Mr. Giriraj Singh said.

The Union Minister pointed out that whenever Mr. Kumar formed the government with BJP, rule of law was the top priority but it had been compromised now.

Janata Dal (United) national president and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh slammed Mr. Giriraj Singh for his statement saying that he did not have any work and communal harmony would continue in Bihar.

Another JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar asked Mr. Giriraj Singh to stop giving sermons on ‘halal’ certificates claiming that many BJP ruled states export beef. He also alleged that Sangeet Som, a BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh is one of the biggest exporters of beef in India."

At Tvam, the art studio at RA Puram where Lakshmi Srinath works on her art, textile and jewellery designing, there is an interplay of light and darkness. The floor, made of black natural stones is juxtaposed with wide windows that bring in plenty of sunlight, reflected in the hues of all that is on display.

Lakshmi has created nine different saris, each with a distinct colour scheme. “The theme for these creations was inspired by Navaratri, and I chose nine goddesses from ancient Vedic and folk traditions. Each of these goddesses is associated with positive energy, and a weapon. These distinct qualities are reflected in the saris I have created,” says Lakshmi. She hopes that it tells a powerful spiritual story.

Lakshmi has collaborated with Aishwarya Manivannan, an artist, designer, educationist, and silambam artiste for this project. “Martial arts and textile art coming together is unique, and this project brought out the various facets of these art forms. It was an opportunity to understand our traditions and history,” says Aishwarya. “As an artiste and designer, I respect Lakshmi’s style and techniques used.”

The designer has used Chanderi fabric for the saris. The colour she has chosen to represent Kowmari, a popular folk deity, is a resplendent yellow. Her weapon is a spear. For Masani Amman who is represented by fire, the theme is a torch of fire and the colour dedicated to her is vermillion red.

“Interestingly, for Andal, also known as Kothai, we normally associate parrots and lotus, but her weapon is a mace. I have used all of these motifs in the sari inspired by her, and the colour I chose is a parrot green,” she says.

Lakshmi was inspired by goddesses Kamakshi, Lakshmi, Andal, Chamundi, Masani, Kowmari, Ayyanar Devi, Saraswathi and Durga. They are aesthetically presented through colours, motifs and themes, says Lakshmi.

Tvam is at 1st Main Road, RA Puram. They can be reached at tvam_artanddesignstudio on Instagram."
4,The Hindu,Govindan accuses Governor of orchestrating a Sangh Parivar-UDF ...,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govindan-accuses-governor-of-orchestrating-a-sangh-parivar-udf-tie-up-to-control-state-universities/article67565495.ece,,"November 23, 2023 05:56 pm | Updated 05:56 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram

Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] State secretary M.V. Govindan accused Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan of endeavouring to hammer out an illicit political alliance”“ between the Sangh Parivar and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) to gain control of State-funded universities in an allegedly underhand manner.

At a press conference, Mr Govindan said Mr. Khan, as the Chancellor of State universities, “coordinated” the political plot.

He accused Mr. Khan of using his nomination powers to stack the governing bodies of State universities with right-wing figures.

Mr. Govindan alleged Mr. Khan had revealed his hand by “disregarding” the panel of Senate nominees submitted by the Vice Chancellor of Calicut University to insert people of his choice into the institution’s apex decision-making body.

He said the Governor’s “questionable” choices included a national leader of the Muslim Youth League, an affiliate of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishad activists, and people with Congress leanings.

“A person nominated from the Industries sector is a pro-UDF person and former varsity employing fighting corruption charges. Another nominated in the journalist category has not seen the inside of a media organisation or practised the profession,” Mr. Govindan said.

Mr. Govindan called Mr. Khan’s actions “norm-breaking, anti-democratic and against the statutes of State-funded universities”. He said the Sangh Parivar subverted the gubernatorial office to thwart the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s bid to use the State’s storied higher education sector as the main driver to transform Kerala into a knowledge economy.

He said the Congress was looking increasingly isolated in the UDF. the IUML had rejected the Congress’s bid to disrupt the Cabinet’s public outreach programme, Navakerala Sadas.

Mr. Govindan slammed Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan for allegedly employing a toxic cocktail of abuse and lies to vilify Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan obsessively. “Mr. Satheesan repeatedly called Mr. Vijayan a criminal. His party compatriot disparaged Mr. Vijayan’s father,” he said.

He accused the corporate media of demonising Mr. Vijayan by parroting Mr. Satheesan’s “abuse and lies”. He said the CPI(M) weighed boycotting television news channel discussions."

Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi said on Thursday that owing to structural and bold reforms, India was growing faster.

The Governor, participating in the valedictory of a seminar on “The G20 New Delhi Leaders Declaration: A Perspective Analysis” at Periyar University here on Thursday, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacy of the world order in addressing a global problem like this. The problems of the world are not mere economic issues. There are many other problems.”

The Governor said when the pandemic started, the prediction was that a minimum of 70 to 80 million people would die. “India invented the vaccines and provided these to over 150 countries.”

Mr Ravi said that in 2015, during the climate change summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi built the International Solar Alliance (ISA), and many countries were not willing to join. But now more than 100 countries were members of the ISA. India’s own capacity of solar energy had gone up more than 20-fold, generating almost 70 gigawatts of solar energy. India also decided that by 2030, half of its energy needs would come from clean energy, and by 2070, it would have zero carbon emissions."

Noting that the road to global economic recovery is still difficult, Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on the G20 member nations to take more practical steps to implement the consensus reached at this year’s New Delhi summit of the forum to ensure development and prosperity.

Mr. Li, who deputised for Chinese President Xi Jinping at the virtual meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Nov. 22, also urged the member countries to accord high priority to development cooperation and oppose the politicisation of development issues.

While many leaders who attended Wednesday’s virtual summit spoke on the Israel-Hamas conflict calling for extending timely humanitarian assistance, not allowing the violence to spread, and finding a long-term solution to the Palestine issue, Mr. Li reportedly focussed on development cooperation among the member countries of the G20.

Excerpts of Mr. Li’s speech reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency late on Nov. 22 night did not refer to the Hamas-Israeli conflict as President Xi articulated China’s stand on the Middle East situation in his speech at the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestine-Israeli issue held by South Africa on Nov. 21.

In his speech Mr. Xi had called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, the release of all civilian captives, and the implementation of a two-state solution for lasting peace in the strife-torn region.

In his speech at Wednesday’s G20 virtual meeting, Mr. Li, ranked number two in the ruling hierarchy Communist Party of China (CPC), said the road to global economic recovery is still difficult and China stands ready to work with all parties to uphold the original aspiration of cooperation, respond to the call of the times, and forge ahead to create a better future for humanity.

Mr. Li called on G20 members to give high priority to development cooperation and oppose the politicisation of development issues and said more practical measures should be taken to implement the consensus reached at the 18th G20 Summit in New Delhi.

Mr. Li has also represented Mr. Xi at the New Delhi summit of the G20 held in September this year as the Chinese President chose to skip it.

China had strongly opposed the negotiations leading up to the G-20 Summit amid increasing tensions and divergent views over the Ukraine conflict.

Mr. Li told the G20 meeting that “it is necessary to coordinate and cooperate more closely, revitalise multilateralism, continue to strengthen macro policy cooperation, and pay more attention to the concerns of developing countries in the reform of the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund”.

Noting China has demonstrated through practical actions its firm determination to promote high-level opening up and to share development opportunities with the world, Mr. Li said China will continue to work with all parties in an open and inclusive manner to make a greater contribution to world economic recovery and global development and prosperity, Xinhua reported."

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has issued an announcement of opportunity (AO) for capacity building in space-based disaster management support.

The agency has invited proposals on capacity-building programmes in different areas of space-based disaster management support from scientists, engineers, and faculty members from centres and units of ISRO, Department of Space, and R&D institutions and recognised academic institutes in India for financial support by ISRO under its Disaster Management Support Programme (DMSP).

“In the Indian sub-continent, nearly a billion people suffer yearly from natural and man-made disasters. Rapid population growth, unprecedented development, extreme climatic events along with complex geo-environmental settings contribute to the increasing effect of disasters. The frequency and impact of natural disasters are increasing day by day. Therefore, there is an urgent need to use both technology and suitable administrative measures along with a societal response to mitigate or reduce the impact of disasters,” stated the AO.

This AO invites proposals for 2023-24. ISRO added that its DMSP has been actively supporting the Central and State governments by providing operational services during pre-disaster, disaster, and post-disaster time-frames, including experimental forecasts, using space systems. “Capacity building in space technology for disaster management has been identified as a key element of sustainable and effective disaster management. However, it is a challenging task considering the diverse backgrounds of stakeholders and the different types of disasters to deal with. Further, it becomes challenging as the issue of disaster management is interwoven with activities related to development, socio-economic conditions, adaptation to climate change scenarios, etc,” ISRO said. The last date for submission is December 20."
8,The Hindu,How Bengaluru band Savaari's anthem resonated with Team India's ...,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bangalore-savaari-music-band-cricket-world-cup/article67563318.ece,,"November 23, 2023 05:00 pm | Updated 06:39 pm IST

Pruthvi Mangiri, the drummer and one of the founders of the Bengaluru-based multilingual fusion band Savaari, listened to the official anthem of the 2023 Cricket World Cup while commuting. He found it somewhat underwhelming. The quadrennial event — the biggest and the most prestigious in cricket — was returning to India after a decade. And Pruthvi and his band felt the occasion needed a better anthem to welcome it. So, they took it upon themselves to create it. Not only compose a song but also release a music video with it. The thing is, India’s first match against Australia was less than 36 hours away. And the band wanted to release the video before the game.

“We literally didn’t sleep the whole night. We kept working throughout the 36 hours,” says Saravana Gowtham, Savaari’s guitarist. The number 36, incidentally, is a memorable one for fans of the Indian cricket team as it got all out for 36 in the second innings of the first Test match before bouncing back to script a historical series victory in Australia in 2020-21.

“We were performing at a show two days before the India-Australia game. That’s when we decided we were going to make the anthem. We didn’t even rest that night. We just went to our homes, freshened up, returned to the studio and started working on it,” Gowtham recalls.

The process was exhausting yet exhilarating. The band members, for instance, engaged in a street cricket match for the music video. “It took us back to our childhood,” says Pruthvi.

The anthem, titled ‘It’s World Cup Time’, is accompanied by visuals of the men in the band playing gully cricket with a tennis ball, a small, gripless bat, and two vertically arranged building blocks as makeshift stumps.

The first few lines of the song are: ‘Rise up baby, It’s World Cup time; 12 years before, We crossed the line; Upwards and strong, We believe it’s time, To win again we want to thrive’.

These words were vindicated when India coasted to a comfortable victory in its first match against Australia. The band members — Pruthvi, Gowtham, Suraj Rajan (vocals and acoustic guitar), Mahesh Jude Pereira (bass and vocals), Ramcharan SR (violin), Abhishek MB (flute and saxophone), Tejas Rajput (percussion), Nadeera Banu (vocals), Pathikrit (photographer and videographer), and Apurba Das (live sound engineer) — were chuffed.

The lyrics, written in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam, mention Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and others. And these players, as the tournament progressed, proved to be the team’s lynchpins. The cricket-crazy members of Savaari found it hard to contain their excitement as India marched to the final of the tournament without a defeat.

Then, whatever happened last Sunday happened. Much like the aspirations of Indian supporters, Savaari’s dreams of witnessing Rohit and his teammates hoist the silver-and-gold trophy were extinguished by the outstanding performance of the Australian team.

The lyrics continued to resonate with the team’s journey until the very end. For, the last stanza begins with the line, ‘If not now then we’ll have to; Wait for four more years.’

Despite the defeat, Pruthvi asserts that the Indian team’s campaign remains truly inspirational. “One match doesn’t define a team’s calibre. Consistent performance is the key. That’s what truly counts,” he says. For a budding band, only a year into its journey, it’s a compelling lesson drawn from the spirit of the Indian team.

The anthem ends with the line: ‘We believe you can; We believe you can’."

India’s decision to resume e-visas for Canadian citizens worldwide is a significant step towards restoring travel ties with Canada, which were snapped in September during the diplomatic stand-off following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations that Indian government agents had masterminded the assassination of a Khalistani leader. While India had restored certain categories of the visa last month, e-visa and tourist visas remained under suspension due to the threat to Indian diplomats from Khalistani groups. According to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, the restoration of visas for Canadians was due to the “situation becoming more secure”. However, the step does not necessarily mean a restoration of normal ties. After India cancelled visas for Canadians and demanded that Canada cut down its diplomatic strength by two-thirds for “parity purposes”, Canada had flown out more than 40 of its diplomats and their family members and reduced its visa issuance capacity as well. With travel visas curtailed on both sides, business and investment ties too suffered, especially as Canada had already suspended talks for a Free Trade Agreement after the killing of the Khalistani leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. While Mr. Jaishankar and the Canadian Foreign Minister met each other in the U.S. in September, political ties have virtually shut down.

In addition, a new controversy, sparked by Washington, has emerged over a report that Indian government agencies were plotting to target another Khalistani leader, Sikhs for Justice leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in the U.S. Like Nijjar, Pannun, a U.S.-Canadian dual national, is wanted in India for inciting violence against Indians and Indian diplomats, and for recently issuing a “warning” to travellers not to take “Air India” flights after November 19. This menacing statement harks back to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 out of Montreal, which killed all 329 on board, in 1985. A White House statement confirmed news reports that U.S. officials had raised the issue during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in June. This indicates that the issue over Khalistani separatists is far from dying down, despite New Delhi’s conversations with western partners at the 2+2 dialogues with the U.S. and Australia, respectively, and Mr. Jaishankar’s recent visit to the U.K. In sharp contrast to the recent past, the government, which had rejected the Canadian allegations as “absurd and motivated”, has been surprisingly accommodating of the U.S.’s allegations. The External Affairs Ministry issued a statement that said India is examining the “U.S. inputs” and would take “necessary follow-up action”. While these are no doubt matters of national security, it is time the government shed some of the secrecy surrounding its dual responses and crafted its future course of action more coherently."

A zone-wise comparison shows that the share of AC seats rose sharply in the Central, Northern and Western Railways, while the rise in Southern and Eastern Railways was not that steep. When both reserved and unreserved passengers are considered, in the Central, Northern and Western Railways, the share of AC seats increased by over 5% points, while Second Class’ share decreased by about 10% points or more.

There is an 80 paise difference per passenger per kilometre between AC 3-tier coaches and reserved Sleeper Class in 2019-20. Moreover, the fare of AC 3-tier has increased by 33 paise per passenger per kilometre in the past decade, while that of reserved Sleeper Class increased only by 17.4 paise, validating the affordability concerns of travellers.

These changes were mandated due to the poor operating ratio of the Indian Railways — which worsened after the pandemic. Before the pandemic Indian Railways on average used to spend ₹98 to earn ₹100. In 2021-22, it spent ₹107 to earn every ₹100.

In the tables, AC class includes AC First tier, AC 2-tier, AC 3-tier and AC Chair Car. Sleeper and Second Classes include coaches in both Ordinary and Mail trains. Only non-suburban trains were considered for this analysis. And only seven Railway zones which have sufficient data were considered.

Wilhelmsen Ship Management (WSM), one of the world’s largest third-party ship managers with a portfolio of more than 450 vessels and 11,000 active seafarers, has announced the expansion of its Indian operations with the introduction of two new functions and increasing the intake of cadets from India and employees in its India office.

Currently Wilhelmsen employs around 3,000 Indian seafarers, constituting nearly 30% of its total global seafarers’ pool. It also has 120 shore-based employees in India. This number is expected to grow by 10% and 25%, respectively, by the end of next year, a top executive said.

“We aim to increase our headcount and establish India as a strategic hub to support our global operations and growth plans.” said Carl Schou, CEO & President, Wilhelmsen Ship Management in an interview.

“We have started two new functions which include Vessel Accounting for ship owners and Ship Inspection Service for buyers and sellers of ships. Now India would be the hub of these two functions and we are adding resources for this,” Mr. Schou said.

He said this expansion was fueled by the growth of the fleet under its management and India’s position as a priority for the company. He also said the company would explore how it could benefit from the facilities being made available at the GIFT City in Gujarat.

Now the key functions performed from the India office include Marine Personnel, Maritime Training, Global Procurement, GSHEQ - Ship Security, Ship Inspection, Vessel Accounting Services and Planned Maintenance Systems.

“India is an important market for us producing some of our finest seafarers. The nation’s education standards produce competent seafarers that have contributed to our success in the gas tanker and car carrier segments.”

The company on Thursday celebrated the Silver Jubilee of its International Maritime Training Centre (IMTC) in Mumbai which has played a crucial role in training Indian seafarers for the challenges of operating technologically advanced ships.

With over 81,000 participants and 6,900 trade tests conducted, IMTC offers a variety of internationally certified courses, including DGS-approved courses.

On the occasion, IMTC introduced it’s first interactive virtual reality training hub that would provide learning experiences that combines emotion and technology.

“This concept will be driven from India and will be replicated to all manning offices network worldwide,” the CEO said.

IMTC will be positioned to be a global training content provider producing quality training content and enhanced learning experience to all Wilhelmsen seafarers globally through e-learning platforms and virtual reality training hub. He said the company is strategically preparing for the 2030 landscape and based on the projection 70% of the world fleet would use conventional fuel, while 20% will run on LNG, and the balance 10% using alternative fuels.

“Leveraging digital systems, we are implementing data-driven strategies and KPIs to reduce fuel consumption. Our investment in training equips our crew members to take emission-conscious initiatives,” he added.

“Through integrating technology, data insights and skilled personnel, we are positioning our operations to support ship owners’ vision for a net zero emission future” Mr. Schou said.

In an industry traditionally dominated by males, the company is now focusing on hiring more women officers and cadets to promote gender diversity.

Currently, female cadets constitute 4% of its yearly intake and the objective is to increase the ratio to 10%. The company recently promoted two female captains since last year and said it would increase the number of women cadets from India year-on-year."

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh on November 23 wrote a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar demanding ban on the production, storage, distribution and sale of food products labelled ‘halal’ in the State.

He made the demand on the lines of Uttar Pradesh government which has banned eatables such as dairy products, sugar, bakery items, peppermint oil, savouries and edible oil labelling halal.

Mr. Giriraj Singh said that action should be taken against the ‘destructive forces’ in Bihar the way Uttar Pradesh did. In the letter, he has written that ‘halal’ business of ‘namkeen’, dry fruits, sweets, medicines was going on whereas the certification related to such items was only done by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. He alleged that companies manufacturing these products were given certificates by paying huge amounts of money and there was ‘big conspiracy’ behind such business.

Along with the letter, he also issued a video statement in which he stressed that in secular democracy ‘halal’ business was not only against the Constitution but also ‘treason’. He further linked it to the ‘terrorist activities’.

“The market is being Islamised in the name of ‘halal’ certificates, the way any work is started by chanting mantras in Sanatan, same is being done by the traders of vote by promoting such things. They are part of the ‘tukde-tukde’ gang and INDIA block. The Congress party nourished it for many years. You visit any shop in Bihar, one can find products labelled ‘halal’. It is like the Jizya tax which wants to establish Sharia law. The Chief Minister of Bihar should immediately impose a ban on such products,” Mr. Giriraj Singh said in the video statement.

He also claimed that ‘halal’ products would play a role in dividing society. Mr. Giriraj Singh asserted that ‘halal’ certification all over the world was ₹2 trillion and the link of this form of economy with terrorist activities coming to the light needed to be investigated thoroughly.

“The way Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji has banned the production, storage and distribution of halal products. I, as a resident of Bihar and Lok Sabha member from Begusarai, urge Bihar CM to impose a ban on ‘halal’ products and take action. There should be an investigation of terrorist activities linked to ‘halal,’” Mr. Giriraj Singh said.

The Union Minister pointed out that whenever Mr. Kumar formed the government with BJP, rule of law was the top priority but it had been compromised now.

Janata Dal (United) national president and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh slammed Mr. Giriraj Singh for his statement saying that he did not have any work and communal harmony would continue in Bihar.

Another JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar asked Mr. Giriraj Singh to stop giving sermons on ‘halal’ certificates claiming that many BJP ruled states export beef. He also alleged that Sangeet Som, a BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh is one of the biggest exporters of beef in India."

At Tvam, the art studio at RA Puram where Lakshmi Srinath works on her art, textile and jewellery designing, there is an interplay of light and darkness. The floor, made of black natural stones is juxtaposed with wide windows that bring in plenty of sunlight, reflected in the hues of all that is on display.

Lakshmi has created nine different saris, each with a distinct colour scheme. “The theme for these creations was inspired by Navaratri, and I chose nine goddesses from ancient Vedic and folk traditions. Each of these goddesses is associated with positive energy, and a weapon. These distinct qualities are reflected in the saris I have created,” says Lakshmi. She hopes that it tells a powerful spiritual story.

Lakshmi has collaborated with Aishwarya Manivannan, an artist, designer, educationist, and silambam artiste for this project. “Martial arts and textile art coming together is unique, and this project brought out the various facets of these art forms. It was an opportunity to understand our traditions and history,” says Aishwarya. “As an artiste and designer, I respect Lakshmi’s style and techniques used.”

The designer has used Chanderi fabric for the saris. The colour she has chosen to represent Kowmari, a popular folk deity, is a resplendent yellow. Her weapon is a spear. For Masani Amman who is represented by fire, the theme is a torch of fire and the colour dedicated to her is vermillion red.

“Interestingly, for Andal, also known as Kothai, we normally associate parrots and lotus, but her weapon is a mace. I have used all of these motifs in the sari inspired by her, and the colour I chose is a parrot green,” she says.

Lakshmi was inspired by goddesses Kamakshi, Lakshmi, Andal, Chamundi, Masani, Kowmari, Ayyanar Devi, Saraswathi and Durga. They are aesthetically presented through colours, motifs and themes, says Lakshmi.

Tvam is at 1st Main Road, RA Puram. They can be reached at tvam_artanddesignstudio on Instagram."

Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] State secretary M.V. Govindan accused Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan of endeavouring to hammer out an illicit political alliance”“ between the Sangh Parivar and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) to gain control of State-funded universities in an allegedly underhand manner.

At a press conference, Mr Govindan said Mr. Khan, as the Chancellor of State universities, “coordinated” the political plot.

He accused Mr. Khan of using his nomination powers to stack the governing bodies of State universities with right-wing figures.

Mr. Govindan alleged Mr. Khan had revealed his hand by “disregarding” the panel of Senate nominees submitted by the Vice Chancellor of Calicut University to insert people of his choice into the institution’s apex decision-making body.

He said the Governor’s “questionable” choices included a national leader of the Muslim Youth League, an affiliate of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishad activists, and people with Congress leanings.

“A person nominated from the Industries sector is a pro-UDF person and former varsity employing fighting corruption charges. Another nominated in the journalist category has not seen the inside of a media organisation or practised the profession,” Mr. Govindan said.

Mr. Govindan called Mr. Khan’s actions “norm-breaking, anti-democratic and against the statutes of State-funded universities”. He said the Sangh Parivar subverted the gubernatorial office to thwart the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s bid to use the State’s storied higher education sector as the main driver to transform Kerala into a knowledge economy.

He said the Congress was looking increasingly isolated in the UDF. the IUML had rejected the Congress’s bid to disrupt the Cabinet’s public outreach programme, Navakerala Sadas.

Mr. Govindan slammed Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan for allegedly employing a toxic cocktail of abuse and lies to vilify Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan obsessively. “Mr. Satheesan repeatedly called Mr. Vijayan a criminal. His party compatriot disparaged Mr. Vijayan’s father,” he said.

He accused the corporate media of demonising Mr. Vijayan by parroting Mr. Satheesan’s “abuse and lies”. He said the CPI(M) weighed boycotting television news channel discussions."

Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi said on Thursday that owing to structural and bold reforms, India was growing faster.

The Governor, participating in the valedictory of a seminar on “The G20 New Delhi Leaders Declaration: A Perspective Analysis” at Periyar University here on Thursday, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacy of the world order in addressing a global problem like this. The problems of the world are not mere economic issues. There are many other problems.”

The Governor said when the pandemic started, the prediction was that a minimum of 70 to 80 million people would die. “India invented the vaccines and provided these to over 150 countries.”

Mr Ravi said that in 2015, during the climate change summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi built the International Solar Alliance (ISA), and many countries were not willing to join. But now more than 100 countries were members of the ISA. India’s own capacity of solar energy had gone up more than 20-fold, generating almost 70 gigawatts of solar energy. India also decided that by 2030, half of its energy needs would come from clean energy, and by 2070, it would have zero carbon emissions."

Noting that the road to global economic recovery is still difficult, Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on the G20 member nations to take more practical steps to implement the consensus reached at this year’s New Delhi summit of the forum to ensure development and prosperity.

Mr. Li, who deputised for Chinese President Xi Jinping at the virtual meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Nov. 22, also urged the member countries to accord high priority to development cooperation and oppose the politicisation of development issues.

While many leaders who attended Wednesday’s virtual summit spoke on the Israel-Hamas conflict calling for extending timely humanitarian assistance, not allowing the violence to spread, and finding a long-term solution to the Palestine issue, Mr. Li reportedly focussed on development cooperation among the member countries of the G20.

Excerpts of Mr. Li’s speech reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency late on Nov. 22 night did not refer to the Hamas-Israeli conflict as President Xi articulated China’s stand on the Middle East situation in his speech at the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestine-Israeli issue held by South Africa on Nov. 21.

In his speech Mr. Xi had called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, the release of all civilian captives, and the implementation of a two-state solution for lasting peace in the strife-torn region.

In his speech at Wednesday’s G20 virtual meeting, Mr. Li, ranked number two in the ruling hierarchy Communist Party of China (CPC), said the road to global economic recovery is still difficult and China stands ready to work with all parties to uphold the original aspiration of cooperation, respond to the call of the times, and forge ahead to create a better future for humanity.

Mr. Li called on G20 members to give high priority to development cooperation and oppose the politicisation of development issues and said more practical measures should be taken to implement the consensus reached at the 18th G20 Summit in New Delhi.

Mr. Li has also represented Mr. Xi at the New Delhi summit of the G20 held in September this year as the Chinese President chose to skip it.

China had strongly opposed the negotiations leading up to the G-20 Summit amid increasing tensions and divergent views over the Ukraine conflict.

Mr. Li told the G20 meeting that “it is necessary to coordinate and cooperate more closely, revitalise multilateralism, continue to strengthen macro policy cooperation, and pay more attention to the concerns of developing countries in the reform of the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund”.

Noting China has demonstrated through practical actions its firm determination to promote high-level opening up and to share development opportunities with the world, Mr. Li said China will continue to work with all parties in an open and inclusive manner to make a greater contribution to world economic recovery and global development and prosperity, Xinhua reported."

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has issued an announcement of opportunity (AO) for capacity building in space-based disaster management support.

The agency has invited proposals on capacity-building programmes in different areas of space-based disaster management support from scientists, engineers, and faculty members from centres and units of ISRO, Department of Space, and R&D institutions and recognised academic institutes in India for financial support by ISRO under its Disaster Management Support Programme (DMSP).

“In the Indian sub-continent, nearly a billion people suffer yearly from natural and man-made disasters. Rapid population growth, unprecedented development, extreme climatic events along with complex geo-environmental settings contribute to the increasing effect of disasters. The frequency and impact of natural disasters are increasing day by day. Therefore, there is an urgent need to use both technology and suitable administrative measures along with a societal response to mitigate or reduce the impact of disasters,” stated the AO.

This AO invites proposals for 2023-24. ISRO added that its DMSP has been actively supporting the Central and State governments by providing operational services during pre-disaster, disaster, and post-disaster time-frames, including experimental forecasts, using space systems. “Capacity building in space technology for disaster management has been identified as a key element of sustainable and effective disaster management. However, it is a challenging task considering the diverse backgrounds of stakeholders and the different types of disasters to deal with. Further, it becomes challenging as the issue of disaster management is interwoven with activities related to development, socio-economic conditions, adaptation to climate change scenarios, etc,” ISRO said. The last date for submission is December 20."
18,The Hindu,How Bengaluru band Savaari's anthem resonated with Team India's ...,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bangalore-savaari-music-band-cricket-world-cup/article67563318.ece,,"November 23, 2023 05:00 pm | Updated 06:39 pm IST

Pruthvi Mangiri, the drummer and one of the founders of the Bengaluru-based multilingual fusion band Savaari, listened to the official anthem of the 2023 Cricket World Cup while commuting. He found it somewhat underwhelming. The quadrennial event — the biggest and the most prestigious in cricket — was returning to India after a decade. And Pruthvi and his band felt the occasion needed a better anthem to welcome it. So, they took it upon themselves to create it. Not only compose a song but also release a music video with it. The thing is, India’s first match against Australia was less than 36 hours away. And the band wanted to release the video before the game.

“We literally didn’t sleep the whole night. We kept working throughout the 36 hours,” says Saravana Gowtham, Savaari’s guitarist. The number 36, incidentally, is a memorable one for fans of the Indian cricket team as it got all out for 36 in the second innings of the first Test match before bouncing back to script a historical series victory in Australia in 2020-21.

“We were performing at a show two days before the India-Australia game. That’s when we decided we were going to make the anthem. We didn’t even rest that night. We just went to our homes, freshened up, returned to the studio and started working on it,” Gowtham recalls.

The process was exhausting yet exhilarating. The band members, for instance, engaged in a street cricket match for the music video. “It took us back to our childhood,” says Pruthvi.

The anthem, titled ‘It’s World Cup Time’, is accompanied by visuals of the men in the band playing gully cricket with a tennis ball, a small, gripless bat, and two vertically arranged building blocks as makeshift stumps.

The first few lines of the song are: ‘Rise up baby, It’s World Cup time; 12 years before, We crossed the line; Upwards and strong, We believe it’s time, To win again we want to thrive’.

These words were vindicated when India coasted to a comfortable victory in its first match against Australia. The band members — Pruthvi, Gowtham, Suraj Rajan (vocals and acoustic guitar), Mahesh Jude Pereira (bass and vocals), Ramcharan SR (violin), Abhishek MB (flute and saxophone), Tejas Rajput (percussion), Nadeera Banu (vocals), Pathikrit (photographer and videographer), and Apurba Das (live sound engineer) — were chuffed.

The lyrics, written in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam, mention Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and others. And these players, as the tournament progressed, proved to be the team’s lynchpins. The cricket-crazy members of Savaari found it hard to contain their excitement as India marched to the final of the tournament without a defeat.

Then, whatever happened last Sunday happened. Much like the aspirations of Indian supporters, Savaari’s dreams of witnessing Rohit and his teammates hoist the silver-and-gold trophy were extinguished by the outstanding performance of the Australian team.

The lyrics continued to resonate with the team’s journey until the very end. For, the last stanza begins with the line, ‘If not now then we’ll have to; Wait for four more years.’

Despite the defeat, Pruthvi asserts that the Indian team’s campaign remains truly inspirational. “One match doesn’t define a team’s calibre. Consistent performance is the key. That’s what truly counts,” he says. For a budding band, only a year into its journey, it’s a compelling lesson drawn from the spirit of the Indian team.

The anthem ends with the line: ‘We believe you can; We believe you can’."

India’s decision to resume e-visas for Canadian citizens worldwide is a significant step towards restoring travel ties with Canada, which were snapped in September during the diplomatic stand-off following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations that Indian government agents had masterminded the assassination of a Khalistani leader. While India had restored certain categories of the visa last month, e-visa and tourist visas remained under suspension due to the threat to Indian diplomats from Khalistani groups. According to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, the restoration of visas for Canadians was due to the “situation becoming more secure”. However, the step does not necessarily mean a restoration of normal ties. After India cancelled visas for Canadians and demanded that Canada cut down its diplomatic strength by two-thirds for “parity purposes”, Canada had flown out more than 40 of its diplomats and their family members and reduced its visa issuance capacity as well. With travel visas curtailed on both sides, business and investment ties too suffered, especially as Canada had already suspended talks for a Free Trade Agreement after the killing of the Khalistani leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar. While Mr. Jaishankar and the Canadian Foreign Minister met each other in the U.S. in September, political ties have virtually shut down.

In addition, a new controversy, sparked by Washington, has emerged over a report that Indian government agencies were plotting to target another Khalistani leader, Sikhs for Justice leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in the U.S. Like Nijjar, Pannun, a U.S.-Canadian dual national, is wanted in India for inciting violence against Indians and Indian diplomats, and for recently issuing a “warning” to travellers not to take “Air India” flights after November 19. This menacing statement harks back to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 out of Montreal, which killed all 329 on board, in 1985. A White House statement confirmed news reports that U.S. officials had raised the issue during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in June. This indicates that the issue over Khalistani separatists is far from dying down, despite New Delhi’s conversations with western partners at the 2+2 dialogues with the U.S. and Australia, respectively, and Mr. Jaishankar’s recent visit to the U.K. In sharp contrast to the recent past, the government, which had rejected the Canadian allegations as “absurd and motivated”, has been surprisingly accommodating of the U.S.’s allegations. The External Affairs Ministry issued a statement that said India is examining the “U.S. inputs” and would take “necessary follow-up action”. While these are no doubt matters of national security, it is time the government shed some of the secrecy surrounding its dual responses and crafted its future course of action more coherently."

Last week, at an election rally in Chhattisgarh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he is extending the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna, a scheme providing 5 kg of foodgrains free every month to beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act, by five years because he does not want any citizen to sleep hungry. This means that 80 crore Indians will still be receiving free foodgrains to stave off hunger in 2028. This is the year the government expects India to become the third largest economy in the world, with a GDP of $5 trillion. Will large swathes of Indians still be hungry with a GDP of $5 trillion? Who will benefit from the five-year dash to these targets?

The story of Japan’s growth

For reference, let’s take a look at Japan today, the third largest economy by GDP in the world. In Japan, there is reportedly a death by suicide every 20 minutes. About 15 lakh Japanese have not left their homes for years, a form of severe social withdrawal known as hikikomori. Old parents rent actresses who come in on Sunday to call them ‘Mom’ and ‘Pop’ because their own daughters don’t visit any more. Every day, dead people are discovered in tiny apartments days or weeks after they died; these are called kodokushi or lonely deaths. Clearly, Japan’s climb to the third position economy-wise has not lifted all boats equally; it has tossed the weak to the margins where they languish because economic growth on steroids has unpicked the safety catch of family and community ties.

For 40 years, Japan was the world’s second largest economy, powered by manufacturing and exports. But after the 2008 world financial crisis, the wheels came off the Japanese economy. Japan’s population started spending less, exports shrank, and government incentives dried up. On the other hand, China enjoyed a manufacturing boom and dislodged Japan to become the world’s second-largest economy by GDP.

On losing rank, however, Japan displayed remarkable ego-free economic diplomacy. As soon as the economy plunged to the third position, Japan’s leadership publicly welcomed China’s ascent, stating that sustained demand from the (then) most populous country could only be good for Japan’s exports. Even if this statement was made partially to save face, the two economies intertwined immediately. Today, China is Japan’s largest trading partner, proving that in the world political economy it pays to embrace your main competitor, even if you are Vishwaguru (global teacher). This ego-free ‘activism’ has ensured that Japan has held on to the third position in world GDP rankings for the last 14 years.

But let us return to the parallel story in Japan. As the high-value industrial economy took centre stage, the strength of personal and professional relationships withered and the multi-generational family and social structure became atomised. This was a perfect storm in the lives of the traditional, semi-skilled workforce. Workers moved from the countryside and satellite towns to cities expecting ‘salaryman’ jobs, but many discovered that they were not trained for the technological tsunami sweeping the high-growth sectors. They fell through the cracks into financial collapse and social withdrawal.

A deep divide

Today, the Government of India claims that the country is on the cusp of an economic tsunami. How does the sprint to the target of $5 trillion bode for citizens, especially the 80 crore who will still be on free rations in 2028? India’s economic growth pivots on capital, productivity and labour, and data show that for over four-fifth of Indians, the $5 trillion economy is a bridge too far.

Consider capital: in 2021, 1% of the population owned about 41% of the nation’s wealth, while 50% owned 3% of its wealth, according to Oxfam. In such an environment, the dash towards a $5 trillion economic trophy lies in the grip of the resource-rich power brokers who will seize the initiative. But ironically, it is the low-resource citizens who are funding the investment for the proposed $5 trillion economy: approximately 64% of the total Goods and Services Tax (GST) came from the bottom 50% of the population, and the top 10% contributed 3% of GST. At the same time, the contribution of labour, the other driver of growth, is hamstrung due to dubious educational and skill attainments and halting digital literacy. Productivity is just beginning to get a boost through the creation of digital and physical infrastructure.

The government is aware that the rich are moving into pole position to deliver the $5 trillion target just before the 2029 general election. Clearly, this will bolster upscale India’s influence and power abroad, and the Prime Minister’s primacy in the world.

The government’s tools and sectors for achieving this goal were identified by the Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhri, in Parliament on August 2023 as “digital economy, fintech, energy transition, climate change… GST, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, decrease in corporate tax, Make in India, Start-Up India, Production Linked Incentives”, all prefaced by the mandatory mantra “inclusive growth”. But these cutting-edge sectors and tools are not native to the 80 crore marginalised citizens and to crores of others. They cannot seize the opportunities on offer in Artificial Intelligence or data science or robotics or fintech — either now or in the next five years.

There are also other issues with Mr. Modi’s guarantee that India will be the third largest economy in five years. First, with a per capita income of $2,400, India ranks 149 among 194 countries in 2022. Since per capita income is a keen index of a population’s well-being, note that the average Japanese at $34,000 is considered better off than the average Chinese at a $13,000, even though China has outstripped Japan in world GDP rankings. What is India’s per capita income projected to be at $5 trillion? There are no official estimates available.

Second, the nub of the chase to $5 trillion GDP is in its distribution, or the inequality index. This index, generated by World Economics, is on a scale of 0-100. A high value indicates a more egalitarian society. The values of both China and Japan are more than 50. These countries appear to be sharing their economic fortunes more evenly than India, which has a value of 21.9.

Will the divide between the two Indias deepen with the $5 trillion target? India might be on its way to achieving this goal, but most of the population still remains marooned in the slow lanes of an older India, watching as the new caravans storm past.

Signature black hair that part neatly into side whiskers, bracketing a scowling face and eyes that glower with fury. To others, he speaks like Donald Trump: climate science is a socialist ploy, abortion rights are unnecessary and social justice is an “aberration”. There are notes of Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro too, with the dogged allegations of possible electoral fraud.

This is Javier Milei — Argentina’s new President. A far-right libertarian, Mr. Milei on November 19 defeated left-wing rival Sergia Massi, in a victory that analysts have described as a “political earthquake” that sent tremors down Argentina’s socialist spine. “Today begins the reconstruction of Argentina. Today begins the end of Argentina’s decline. The model of decadence has come to an end,” Mr. Milei said in his victory speech, to a rallying cry of “¡¡Qué se vayan todos!!” All of them must go. Them, being the ‘thieves’ in the political elite who have overseen the Latin American country’s worst economic crisis in four decades.

Mr. Milei — an economist and TV pundit — has established a reputation as a disruptor. His signature campaign promise: to ‘blow up’ the central bank, and replace the local peso with the U.S. dollar. Argentina’s economic and social order needs to be ripped apart, even set alight, because, only from ashes can Mr. Milei “truly make Argentina Great Again”.

Origin story

The 53-year-old was born and brought up in Buenos Aires. With his parents — father a bus driver and mother a homemaker — he shares a ‘complicated relationship’, journalist Juan Luis González wrote in an unauthorised biography. The book documented a troubled childhood where Mr. Milei was physically and verbally abused at home, and bullied at school. In school itself Mr. Milei came to be known as ‘El Loco’. The madman.

Mr. Milei played in his school’s football team as a goalkeeper, a position carved for people “who live on the edge”, he said in a 2017 interview with El Cronista. He was a singer of a youth group called Everest that specialised in covers of Rolling Stones (he has seen the band live 14 times). From Elvis Presley, Mr. Milei said he was inspired to write rock and roll songs, albeit with economic themes, thus generating a product that “meets the market’s desires” and “reaffirms the Austrian [school of economics]”. Both music and money, in keeping with his libertarian values, ought to be freed from state political control Today, he describes himself as an “anarcho-capitalist” who is “above all for freedom”.

Mr. Milei shares a close relationship with his sister, Karina, whom he calls “the boss”, according to ABC News. He is unmarried, and presently dating actor Fátima Flórez. The other documented public relationship is with his dog, the English Mastiff Conan, who passed away in 2017. Mr. Milei reportedly cloned Conan’s DNA, a procedure which resulted in five puppies, each named after an economist. As per a Forbes report, Mr. Milei believes Conan told him in a telepathic conversation that it is God’s mission for him to become Argentina’s President. Mr. Milei, in an interview with The Economist, has also referred to his dogs as his “strategists” and “political analysts”.

More than his ideas, Mr. González wrote in the biography, “what worries me is [Mr. Milei’s] state of mind and emotional stability.”

A libertarian economist

At 12, Mr. Milei was drawn to Economics, at a time Argentina reeled under the 1989 hyperinflation crisis. Theory suggests that when prices rise, demand should fall, but Mr. Milei saw desperate Argentines “jumping” to buy food at elevated prices. Either “I’m an idiot or the books are wrong,” he recollected in an article. “I stopped playing soccer and dedicated myself to studying. I became fanatic, almost pathologically, with Economics.” In May, he suggested legislating the sale of human organs — a “market mechanism” to solve for the lack of organ donations in the country.

Mr. Milei’s has worked with Argentina’s leading Corporación America business group; taught economic subjects in domestic and international universities; authored more than 50 academic papers; and as of 2018, was among the most interviewed economists on TV, a ranking showed. While the world may see Mr. Milei’s political likeness in Trump and Bolsanaro, the President-elect prefers to go by the titles “Adam Smith’s heir”, “the Mozart of Economics”, “the Keynesian Wrecker”.

During his career as a TV pundit, Mr. Milei built a model of popularity fuelled by profanity and panning. Mr. Milei had diagnosed the centre-left Peronist model and excessive government spending as Argentina’s malady, and prescribed an immediate halt to taxes and subsidies. He generously used expletives and aggressive rhetoric, reserved mostly for rivals and the country’s political elite: to him, the former socialist government is best described as a “paedophile in a kindergarten”. Pope Francis is an “imbecile” and a “representative of malignance on Earth”. A journalist called Mr. Milei’s ideological views totalitarian, to which he responded by calling her a “donkey” (a local court accused of him exerting gender violence and mandated psychological examination). His screeds are not always political or economic — on occasions, he has offered tips on intercourse, and positioned himself as an expert in tantric sex.

In 2021, Mr. Milei led into the Argentine National Congress his party alliance La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), a group which among its candidates includes neo-Nazis and apologists of the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983.

Mr. Milei shocked political commentators in August this year, emerging victorious as the candidate with the highest vote share in Argentina’s primary elections. “Milei came from nowhere… and his popularity came from the disaster of the bad performance of the economy in the last 12 years,” said economist Andres Borenstein to a media outlet. Almost 40% of Argentines live in poverty. The three-figure inflation rate has unmade and remade records. Year-on-year deficit and fiscal negligence have plunged the country deep into debt. The common man is angry, and no one speaks this language of outrage better than Mr. Milei, analysts have observed. Mr. Milei brandished a chainsaw at a protest, symbolic of his promise of slashing all things decadent and unnecessary; only a ‘shock therapy’ can heal a diseased system that is the “root of all evil”, he has previously said.

Unlayering Mr. Milei’s popularity, Andrés Malamud, a researcher at the University of Lisbon, explained that he appeals to the basic instincts of liberty, life and property. “That’s why Milei loves television sets, where he yells, insults and crushes anyone who criticises him. O”

Conservative political ideas

Media outlets describe Mr. Milei as a “far-right outsider”, a “radical” libertarian. He refuses both labels. “I’m a liberal and libertarian, these positions are things of the left, because for the left, everything that is not on their side is on the right,” he said at a rally.Though he identifies as a libertarian outsider, he “combines that hyper-liberal ideology and freedom with elements of the extreme-right”, said Pablo Touzón, a political scientist.

Mr. Milei believes climate change is a “lie of socialism”; COVID-19 vaccines are a hoax and government spending on scientific research must be curbed. Women’s rights activists say his victory paints a bleak picture ahead -- Mr. Milei has opposed abortion rights, even in rape cases (Argentina in 2020 became the largest Latin American country to legalise abortion), and dismissed sex education as a form of Marxist brainwashing. “There is a hard nucleus of La Libertad Avanza voters who are young men... who are resistant to the advances of women and the LGBT community,” journalist Adriana Carrasco told The Guardian. Mr. Milei acknowledges freedom of choice -- in matters of gun control, sex work, sexual preference and gender identity.

Once elected to power, he promises to nip bureaucracy by reducing the number of ministries from 18 to eight (closing ministries of culture, women, health, environment and education), while also making ‘progressive’ cuts to retirement and pension funds. He has previously expressed a desire to privatise education and health care: “Everything than can be [put] into the hands of the private sector, will be in the hands of the private sector,” he said. Mr. Milei said he is aligned with the United States, Israel, and “the free world”, and pledges to cut ties with “communist” countries like China and Brazil.

Mr. Touzón explained that Mr. Milei sees himself as a “warrior against the State” -- “a war machine against [the political class]...a brick thrown against the window of a jewellery store.”

Argentina’s future

Mr. Milei’s victory charts a sharp new path for Argentina, but this is not necessarily course correction, analysts say. While Mr. Milei may struggle to take control and implement his controversial ideas (his party controls just 38 of 257 seats in Argentina’s lower house), if realised, his policies could bring in “absolute chaos”.

To a self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalism, chaos may not seem as daunting. Lilia Lemoine, a professional cosplayer turned congresswoman-elect, termed Mr. Milei as an “anti-hero”. “He looks like Wolverine. He acts like Wolverine... He can get really mad and be aggressive with his enemies – but only when he’s attacked. He will never ever kill someone or attack someone for no reason,” she said in an interview. What counts as reason, for a rabble-rouser committed to extinguishing the embers of socialism? Activists and analysts are sceptical, worrying that Argentina’s social justice landscape, built with care and commitment, will be put into question.

For now, Mr. Milei has declared “there is no way back”. “Argentina is going to reclaim the place in the world that it should never have lost,” he said in his victory speech. As a ‘lion’, he said he wants not ‘to guide lambs’, but to ‘wake up lions’. Only they can reconfigure the government, and set anew Argentina’s policies on economics, human rights, and foreign policy. But before lions are awakened, brickbats hurled and windows cracked open, the economically fragile nation is bound to wonder: What place and freedom do Mr. Milei, and Conan, have in store for Argentina?"
22,The Hindu,Deceptive signals: The Hindu Editorial on India's October 2023 ...,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/deceptive-signals-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-october-2023-goods-exports-numbers/article67567242.ece,,"November 24, 2023 12:35 am | Updated 08:33 am IST

Last month, India’s goods exports recorded only their second uptick this financial year, with a 6.2% rise. Merchandise imports grew a sharper 12.3% over last October and nearly 21% over September’s tally to hit an all-time high of $65.03 billion. The trade deficit, as a result, also hit a record $31.5 billion. The import bill was expected to go beyond the relatively tepid trends in recent months, spurred by anticipation of festive demand for items such as jewellery and high-end electronics. But this surge, and the deficit tally, was beyond expectations, with economists describing it as ‘a rude shock’ thanks to ‘idiosyncratic’ effects. The Finance Ministry’s monthly economic review asserted that merchandise exports “surprised on the upside” with the highest growth in 11 months, and that exports and imports have grown “despite fears of weak global demand”.

The high imports and the likely deficit trajectory need not trigger much anxiety yet. The recent decline in oil prices should help this inelastic import bill recede from the seven-month high of $17.7 billion. While festive and wedding demand spiked gold and silver imports to an extent, price drops in precious metals in early October also played a role as jewellers sought to ramp up stocks before prices rebounded. Similarly, not all of the bump up in electronics imports can be construed as consumption demand. That October was the last month of free imports of personal computers, laptops and servers before the ‘deferred’ implementation of new import ‘licensing’ norms, now euphemistically rephrased as an ‘import management system’, also triggered players into stockpiling inventories of these items. The government has been trying to rein in the import bill through such measures and a slew of quality control orders, but boosting exports is more critical to support job creation and economic growth. What is worrying is October’s headline uptick in exports is a statistical kink – the shipments’ value of $33.6 billion is actually the lowest in 12 months and 6% below the 2021 tally. Global trade grew 2% month-on-month in October, but Indian exports dropped 2.6%. This is a clear sign that incremental opportunities that a slowing world is throwing up are being lost out on."
23,The Hindu,Tamil Nadu plans to achieve Net Zero emissions at least a decade ...,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-plans-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-at-least-a-decade-ahead-of-2070-says-industries-minister-trb-rajaa/article67566890.ece,,"November 24, 2023 12:38 am | Updated 12:38 am IST - CHENNAI

Tamil Nadu’s Minister for Industries T.R.B. Rajaa said that the State plans to achieve Net Zero [emission] at least a decade ahead of 2070. “As a State that is adding value to the idea of India, we would definitely want to be a [leading] State when it comes to using renewable and sustainable materials in construction,” the Minister said.

“This government will listen and is open to ideas. We request the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) and the stakeholders present here to bring ideas to enable the State to become much more sustainable. We will ensure that all the requests from the industry are heard and rapid action is taken, and see how change can be brought about. We would also ensure that we build greener buildings. At the pace in which Tamil Nadu’s economy is growing, we intend to take the greenest route possible,” the Minister said at the Green Building Congress 2023 event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) IGBC.

In an effort to achieve the Net-Zero Carbon Emission goal, the IGBC announced India’s first ‘Net Zero Carbon’ rating system during the event.

“The benefits of this rating system are multifaceted. Beyond supporting India’s climate goals through carbon reduction, it encourages resource efficiency, adoption of energy-efficient systems, integration of renewable energy sources, responsible water use, waste minimisation and climate-resilient building designs. The rating system presents an excellent opportunity for the building sector to lead the adoption of Net Zero practices and facilitate India’s transformation into being one of the frontrunners in the Net-Zero target by 2050,” said Gurmit Singh Arora, Chairman, IGBC.

Mr. Arora further said that the Government of India, over the last two decades, has initiated several new missions and policies that support the path towards Net Zero carbon buildings and cities. “The green building movement in India has been spearheaded by CII’s IGBC since 2001 by creating awareness amongst the stakeholders. Till date, the council has been instrumental in enabling 10.42 billion sq.ft. of green building footprint in the country,” he added.

Jamshyd N Godrej, Chairman, CII-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre, said, “In terms of green buildings, India has been seen as a follower. We stand number two in the world, whereas, in case of net zero buildings, we have a great opportunity to take a leadership role and make India the top country in the world. I am sure that the deliberations in the next three days will help the stakeholders to understand the strategies to be taken to achieve the common goal for Net Zero,” he added.

Ajit Chordia, Chairman, IGBC, Chennai Chapter, said, “Tamil Nadu’s commitment towards the green building movement can be witnessed through many landmark projects such as the IGBC certified buildings - Anna Centenary Library, Chennai Metro Rail Limited, Smart Governance Centre, among others.”

The launch of the IGBC Net-Zero Carbon rating system is in alignment with ‘IGBC’s Mission on Net Zero’, which was launched on Earth Day in 2021, and India’s commitment at COP26, which is to achieve the long-term goal of reaching Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070. The rating system operates on a voluntary and consensus-based approach, promoting the use of low-embodied carbon materials and technologies, and on-site or off-site renewable energy sources, and adherence to a whole building life cycle analysis as per ISO Standard 14040. The rating system addresses projects in both ‘Design & Construction’ and ‘Operations’ phases. This approach allows tailored strategies for minimising or eliminating carbon emissions at different project stages."

The Chhattisgarh Assembly elections were conducted in two phases on November 7 and 17. A comparison of the social indicators of the State with those of other States shows that Chhattisgarh has improved in most measures in recent years. But despite the improvement, the State features in the bottom half of the rankings in many indicators.

Chhattisgarh’s economic performance is relatively poor given that the manufacturing sector’s contribution is marginal. However, the State has managed to feature in the top half of the rankings in education-related parameters.

Table 1 | The table shows Chhattisgarh’s rank in social indicators and its actual score in a parameter in 2019-21, 2015-16, and 2005-06. It also lists the change in Chhattisgarh’s rank in 2019-21 from 2015-16. The top three States in a parameter are also given for comparison.

For instance, Chhattisgarh had an infant mortality rate of 44.3 in 2019-21 and ranked 28 out of 30 States. The three best major States that year were Kerala (4.4), Tamil Nadu (18.6) and West Bengal (22). Chhattisgarh’s ranking improved by one spot in 2019-21 from 2015-16, the year it was placed 29 out of 30.

As can be seen in Table 1, Chhattisgarh’s ranking improved in six of the eight parameters analysed, declined in one, and remained unchanged in another. In the share of the population that used an improved sanitation facility, the State’s ranking improved by 12 spots, and in the share of wasted children (low weight-for-height), it improved by seven spots between 2015-16 and 2019-21.

In fact, a comparison with the data of 2005-06 shows significant improvement across most social indicators. In all the indicators, the State ranked 20 or worse in the 28 States analysed in that period (the data of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were ignored). That is not the case any more.

Despite this improvement, the State continues to rank lower than most others in many indicators. Only close to 69.3% of the female population aged six years and above have ever attended school (Chhattisgarh ranked 23 of 30 States in this parameter) though teenage marriages have come down drastically. Except for the share of households with health insurance coverage, where the State ranks second, in many other social indicators, it is in the bottom half of the rankings or at least not among the top 10 States.

Table 2 | The table shows Chhattisgarh’s per capita net state domestic product in 2021-22.

Chhattisgarh lacks economic progress to fuel its social development. In terms of per capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2021-22 (Table 2), it is ranked 23rd out of 29 States. Close to 60% of the population was in the lowest two wealth quintiles in 2020 — the fifth highest share among the States analysed (Table 3).

Table 3 | The table shows the share of the population belonging to the lowest two wealth quintiles in Chhattisgarh.

Only 5.5% of the workforce is employed in the manufacturing sector. On this parameter, Chhattisgarh ranks 25th in India, with the sector contributing to 12.6% of the total GVA (Table 4).

Table 4 | The table shows Chhattisgarh‘s rank in indicators related to manufacturing.

The State performed relatively better in educational parameters (Table 5). It featured in the top half of the rankings list in the category of enrolment rates across various stages of school education.

Table 5 | The table shows Chhattisgarh’s rank in indicators related to education.

In environment-related parameters, the State showed mixed progress. Chhattisgarh generated on average 8.56 metric tonnes of hazardous waste per 1,000 people in 2018, ranking 20th out of 28 States. But it generated only 0.21 tonnes of plastic waste per 1,000 people in 2018-19 — the fifth-lowest in India as shown in Table 6.

Table 6 | The table shows Chhattisgarh’s rank in environment-related indicators.

Due to poor rankings in social measures despite improvements and despite a better ranking in educational parameters, the State was ranked 24th of 30 States in the 2021 Human Development Index.

25,The Hindu,"At COP 28, a fair share of the global carbon budget is at stake ...",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/cop-28-fair-share-global-carbon-budget-explained/article67564460.ece,,"November 23, 2023 11:00 am | Updated November 24, 2023 11:38 am IST

There is an almost linear relationship between global warming and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 noted that per capita emissions in developing countries are still “relatively low” and that their share in the global emissions will grow to meet their social and developmental needs.

The Convention recognises the ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR-RC) principle. This means different States have different responsibilities and respective capabilities in tackling climate change. This principle has been reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement, whose main aim is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels’‘ and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels”.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6), every 1,000 billion tonnes of CO 2 in emissions causes an estimated 0.45 degrees C rise in the global surface temperature. Axiomatically, limiting the rise in global temperature to a specific level means limiting cumulative carbon dioxide emission to within a carbon budget.

What is the global carbon budget?

The term ‘global carbon budget’ refers to the maximum cumulative global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions – from the pre-industrial era to when such emissions reach net- zero, resulting in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability. The remaining carbon budget indicates how much CO 2 could still be emitted, from a specified time after the pre-industrial period, while keeping temperature rise to the specified limit.

The IPCC AR6 has shown that the world warmed by a staggering 1.07 degrees C until 2019 from pre-industrial levels, so almost four-fifths of the global carbon budget stands depleted. Only a fifth remains to meet the target set in the Paris Agreement.

For a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C, the U.S. would have to reach net-zero in 2025, rather than 2050; Germany by 2030 instead of 2045; and the EU-28 bloc by 2031 instead of 2050.

Who’s responsible for cumulative global emissions?

According to the IPCC AR6, the developed countries have appropriated a disproportionately larger share of the global carbon budget to date. The contribution of South Asia – which includes India – to historical cumulative emissions is only around 4% despite having almost 24% of the entire world population. The per capita CO 2 -FFI (fossil fuel and industry) emissions of South Asia was just 1.7 tonnes CO 2 -equivalent per capita, far below North America (15.4 tonnes CO 2 -eq. per capita) and also significantly lower than the world average (6.6 tonnes CO 2 -eq. per capita).

How does the carbon budget matter for India?

The global carbon budget for a given temperature limit is a global resource, common to the entire world, but is exhaustible and limited and with only equitable methods of sharing it, consistent with the foundational principles of the UNFCCC. India must recognise ‘fair share of the carbon budget’ as a strategic national resource whose reserves are depleting rapidly due to over-exploitation by developed countries.

In a rapidly depleting global carbon budget, if we fail to deploy resources at our command to forcefully use it as a strategic national resource, we will be shortchanged by new colonial techniques of developed countries. In almost all the emissions scenarios estimated by the IPCC, the world breaches an increase of 1.5 degrees C from pre-industrial levels in the early 2030s.

In 2022, oil, coal and gas accounted for 30%, 27% and 23% of the world’s total energy, while solar and wind energy together contributed only 2.4%. The world is still largely powered by non-renewable energy. Developed countries have tried to browbeat developing countries into accepting rapid, economy-wide changes. At the COP 26 talks in Glasgow, they forced the issue of phasing down the use of coal but then backtracked by reopening coal plants across Europe after the Russia-Ukraine war created an energy crisis.

This has illustrated that immediate phaseout of fossil fuels is infeasible in the face of shocks and also limits developing countries’ access to their ‘room to grow’. The developed countries have stretched the argument further by calling gas “green” and a “bridge fuel” towards their own decarbonisation efforts.

What should India’s stance be at COP 28?

According to the NITI Aayog-U.N. Development Programme’s Multidimensional Poverty Index Report 2023 review, India has been able to lift more than 135 million poor out of poverty in less than five years (2015-2021). India has also just extended food security welfare measures to more than 800 million people in the country, under the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna, highlighting the magnitude of the challenge of poverty eradication after COVID-19.

Development is the first defence against climate change. How long will developing countries have to divert their scarce resources, manpower, and attention to meeting global problems created by developed countries? Until developed countries themselves undertake mitigation efforts in their own backyard, the exercise will be a hogwash. It is imperative that developing countries receive a fair and equitable share of their carbon budget alongside stronger and more fruitful commitments from developed countries – including the promised but unmet climate-specific new and additional finance.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has led from the front to foster international consensus to tackle climate change. To this end, India has set up the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and the Global Biofuel Alliance. Through the ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ (LiFE) mission, the Indian government also aims to spread awareness of good lifestyle practices and establish that sustainable lifestyles are the best way forward.

At COP28, India must demand a fair share of its carbon budget or equivalent reparations to bring about fairness within the global order.

Only development brings with it an assurance to tide over the roller coasters of climate change. Scientists estimate that at a conservative price of $50/tCO 2 -eq, developed countries’ carbon debt to the world is pegged at over $51 trillion. Based on India’s historical emissions (1850-2019), it has a carbon credit equivalent of 338 GtCO 2 -eq., equal to around $17 trillion at $50/tCO 2 -eq.Without finance and technology as promised in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, developing countries stare at an even more unfair world.

The cover decision of the Glasgow Climate Pact recorded an unprecedented “regret” on the failure of the developed countries to provide US $100 billion dollars a year, as promised at the COP 15 talks in Copenhagen in 2009. We need more finance and less rhetoric from developed countries. For far too long, developed countries have had a free pass, and it is time for a new India to take them on.

26,The Hindu,What has the U.K. Supreme Court ruled with respect to the Rwanda ...,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/what-has-the-uk-supreme-court-ruled-with-respect-to-the-rwanda-deal-explained/article67563219.ece,,"November 23, 2023 08:30 am | Updated 08:30 am IST

The story so far: The government policy of the U.K., of creating a mechanism for the transfer of asylum seekers not considered by the U.K. to Rwanda, has been ruled as unlawful by the U.K. Supreme Court.

What is the Rwanda deal?

The Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP) was announced in April 2022 by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The objective of the deal is to “create a mechanism” for the transfer of asylum seekers not considered by the UK into Rwanda. The inadmissibility clause of the UK’s asylum system plays a key role in categorising people who enter the U.K. through “irregular journeys” such as the English Channel. According to the Memorandum of Understanding between the two nations, the U.K. will screen asylum seeker applications and arrange for safe transport to Rwanda. On arrival of the refugees, Rwanda is obliged to provide accommodation for every individual and protect them from ill-treatment and refoulement. Rwanda will be the sole authority to recognise or not recognise the refugee status of an individual. If an individual is not recognised, they will be moved to their country of origin.

Why did the U.K. choose Rwanda?

Rwanda offers three solutions for those sent out by the U.K.. It facilitates returning them to their country of origin; helps in moving them to a third country; or helps them settle in Rwanda with decent housing, access to universal health insurance and the right to work. The U.K. will bear the accommodation and transit costs. Rwanda was not the first country to be approached. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair attempted to persuade Tanzania for asylum claims but failed. Britain’s colonial history aligns with the current scenario where it used to move particular sections of migrant labour to certain territories. The U.K. has, in the past, moved refugees to colonised countries under the guise of development and economic growth. The MEDP arrangement resonates with this colonial scheme of dispersing refugees.

Why was it ruled unlawful?

The ruling was based on two major issues. One, the Court of Appeal’s entitlement to intervene in the High Court’s ruling, and two, if the Court of Appeal had looked into the real risk for asylum seekers when moved to Rwanda. On the first, the Supreme Court found the High Court decision to be “erred,” due to its failure to consider the evidence of the risk of refoulement. Under the European Court, it is the U.K.s responsibility as a removing state to protect the refugee from refoulement and ensure asylum. Instead, the High Court recognised the expertise and promise of Rwanda.

Second, the Supreme Court found evidence that asylum seekers face a real risk of ill-treatment from refoulement. Rwanda’s track record on human rights and its non-compliance with assurances were taken as instances for considering the real risk of refoulement. While Rwanda has become a key partner of the U.K., the court highlighted the periods of violence in Rwanda since 1994 and how its human rights record was viewed as critical for the ruling.

Why are domestic responses mixed?

The reason behind different perceptions is the uncertainty over the legality of the arrangement and treatment of the refugees in Rwanda.

According to civil society organisations, double voluntarism from the U.K. and Rwanda to create a safe transit or guaranteeing rights is impossible. The UNHCR clearly states that once a refugee enters a territory via land or sea it becomes the responsibility of the respective country to ensure the safety of the refugee. In this case, the U.K. cannot be relieved from this duty even after the transfer of the refugee to Rwanda. While the U.K. government argues over simultaneous investment in refugees and Rwanda’s economy for development, the doubts over refoulement and the implications to other EU countries do not seem to end.

India plans to ask state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to consider launching a rights issue to help fund green projects at refining arm Hindustan Petroleum Corp, two sources said, an exercise that could raise about $1.9 billion.

The comments come after India's finance minister announced a plan this year to provide equity of ₹300 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) to help the big state oil refiners move towards cleaner energy.

The government is weighing options for HPCL, including directly providing loans at preferential rates, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter. They sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak with media.

The oil ministry is awaiting a response from the finance ministry on the plan for ONGC to launch a rights issue, one of the sources said.

Based on rights issues previously announced by two other state refiners, an ONGC issue could amount to about ₹155 billion ($1.86 billion), Reuters calculations show.

In 2018, New Delhi sold its entire stake of 51.1% in HPCL to ONGC, making the firm a subsidiary of India's top energy explorer. The government holds a stake of 58.93% in ONGC.

Initially, the government had planned to infuse funds into HPCL by allocation of preferential shares, but that risked pushing ONGC's stake below 50% and ending the government's indirect control of HPCL, one of the sources said.

ONGC, HPCL and the oil and finance ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

India's other big state refiners, Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp have announced plans to launch rights issues of ₹220 billion and ₹180 billion, respectively.

The government has a 51.5% stake in IOC and 52.98% share in BPCL.

However, a lack of clarity from the government over how to infuse funds into HPCL has delayed the launch of rights issues for IOC and BPCL, sources said. Those issues had earlier been planned by the end of October, sources have said.

Combined, the three refiners aim to invest ₹3.5 trillion to ₹4 trillion to reach a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040."

A royal tale with moments that leave a lump in your throat is captured in frames. The photo exhibition of Ranavalona III, the Chrysalis Queen, at Alliance Francaise in Hyderabad revisits a chapter in history to recreate the story of Ranavalona III, the last queen of Madagascar (1861-1917) envied by many but, with oppressive traditions and domination, experienced exhilaration and deep pain in the end.

Artistic interpretation

The exhibition is a curtain raiser to the ongoing 9th edition of the Indian Photo Festival 2023 across the city. French photographer Christian Randrianampizafy explains the show is not intended to be a historical narration of her life; it only aims to highlight certain facets of her personality through an artistic interpretation. He hopes oppressed women across the world perceive these memories as the light of a firefly to guide them in their fight.

“The project’s approach is not to rewrite history but suggest a perspective. As a queen, she was expected to have a nice life. However, she was manipulated by her husband, lived a life in exile and died outside Madagascar. The goal is to rekindle her memories,” says Christian who is also currently the director of Alliance Francaise in Bengaluru. Using a Nikon D5 to shoot photographs, he has collaborated with Gaby Saranouffi for the project. While historical documentation is by Bako Rasoarifetra, lighting and music is by Hygor Mukusu and Rajery. With a blend of photography and choreography, the exhibition, divided into three parts : Sloughing (dancer Gayatri Shetty), Unveiling and Fall (model and choreography Gaby Saranouffi) recreates different emotions.

Viewers are introduced to a cheerful Ranavalona in Sloughing. Floating like a butterfly, she is set to live the life of her dreams. The dynamic images capture her expressive eyes and explore her character and mood through movements. In Unveiling, we see her new home, the palace which is more like a cage. She is dressed like a royal but is isolated in this iron structure with hardly any open space. Desperate and alone, she plays with a chair symbolically representing a throne. The following images show her conversion to Christianity and praying.

The black and white photographs — consciously designed such to depict strong emotions — show her banished and exiled from the country. In one, Ranavalona stares at the camera with an agonised expression with her back facing the sea. “I had read about her panic on seeing the sea for the first time. It was difficult for her to go near the water and take a boat. I wanted to capture that fear,” says Christian.

The third part, the final set of photographs show her death but with an uplifted right hand a la Statue of Liberty, the photograph brings hope. “We need to believe there is life and resurrection after death. I took this picture to give hope to all women suffering.”

A collection of outfits showcased at the display plays a significant part in narrating her journey - a delicate cotton gown representing her carefree adolescence to historic robes depicting her royal connect.

Originally from Madagascar, Christian has been living in Bengaluru since September 2020 and shot the photographs in Bengaluru and South Africa in 2022. He first read about Ranavalona III’s story five years ago. Shocked and touched by her tale, the photographer felt recreating her story in the modern context will aid women, who are suffering. “Her tragic story is well known, but I wanted to move ahead; I want her life to be a glimmer of light to give hope and warmth to the aching hearts of oppressed women.”

‌The Indian government has requested Google to take down around 1.1 lakh content from its platforms between 2013 and 2022, according to a Surfshark study. India has emerged third in the list of countries that send most number of requests for content removal to Google.

The research showed that in total India had registered 19.6k requests over the past decade with every request including multiple items with ‘defamation’ being the most frequent reason behind a request.

“Government requests for content removal from Google products are on the rise. In the past decade, the global count has surged nearly 13 times — from 7k to 91k requests annually,” the lead researcher at Surfshark, Agneska Sablovskaja stated .She pointed out how the notable increase in content removal requests to Google by governments during global conflict and wars pushed her to understand the genuine nature of the requests and if they were to safeguard national security or potentially censor opposition.

India has asked for eight times more content to be removed from Google over the last decade compared to Bangladesh.

(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache)

The requests were made across platforms managed by Google with most attention given to YouTube. “Most of the content India requested to remove was from YouTube (8.8k), Google Play Apps (4.3k) and Web Search (1.4k),” the report stated.

The top three biggest requesters for content removal from India have been the police, court orders directed at Google, and Information and Communications authority.

Russia topped the list for most requests for content removal with 2.15 lakh requests in the last nine years, seeking removal of nearly 2 million items."

As the campaigning for the November 25 Assembly polls in Rajasthan ended on November 23, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that the State is all set to break its tradition of evicting incumbents, and will bring the Ashok Gehlot government back to power.

The Congress also released a video of former party chief Rahul Gandhi interacting with beneficiaries of the flagship Chiranjeevi health scheme, where he pledged that the scheme would ensure free treatment of up to ₹50 lakh from the present ₹25 lakh.

In a post in Hindi on X, Mr. Kharge said that Rajasthan, the land of heroes and warriors, has accepted the party’s public welfare schemes. “Thanks to more than one crore families for reposing their trust in the seven guarantees of the Congress party. There is an environment in favour of the Congress party in the entire State,” he said.

Seven guarantees

The Congress chief claimed that the BJP was scared of the incumbent government’s social justice, economic empowerment, savings, and relief schemes.

“Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi ji and Home Minister Amit Shah are busy making hollow, absurd and divisive remarks, they are not able to digest the seven guarantees made by the Congress party. This time the public will not fall for their lies, deception and hateful words. The people of Rajasthan have decided that this time, the tradition will change and they will give another opportunity to the Congress,” Mr. Kharge said.

Free treatment

To underscore the popularity of its Chiranjeevi scheme, the Congress also released a five-minute video of Mr. Gandhi interacting with cancer patients at Jaipur’s Mahatma Gandhi hospital, where the patients lauded the scheme.

Sharing the video on his X handle, Mr. Gandhi said: “Chiranjeevi Yojana - free treatment up to ₹50 lakh, India’s best scheme! The beneficiary patients and their families themselves are confirming this in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital. Modi ji, this is called guarantee - to support in times of trouble, to walk shoulder to shoulder. If you want to see it, come to our Rajasthan sometime!”"

The U.K.’s policy towards Ayurveda products is not part of negotiations on the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA), The Hindu has learnt. The U.K. grants Traditional Herbal Registration for herbal or homeopathic medicines that are used to treat minor health conditions. But use of Ayurveda for serious health issues will require stringent tests.

“To be authorised for treatment of a major health condition, an ayurvedic product would need to provide robust clinical trials data proving safety, quality and efficacy that meets the requirements for full marketing authorization,” The Hindu was told by sources familiar with the UK’s policy on Ayurveda products.

Herbal medicines

The U.K. has a policy in place for traditional herbal medicines covering a large number of items that are widely used in Indian Ayurvedic products. As per a list published in 2014 by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, many Indian ingredients like sarpagandha (Rauwolfia serpentine), khat or qat (Catha edulis) that are often used in Ayurveda products are either “banned” or “restricted”. Responding to a query from this paper, a source indicated that the UK will deal with Ayurveda items under a different track and said, “this policy is separate” from the ongoing FTA negotiation between the two sides..

India and the U.K. have completed thirteen rounds of negotiation over the Free Trade Agreement but there are several areas where consensus is yet to be reached. The negotiation has been aided by political support over the last two years but the two sides have not managed to bridge the gap in crucial areas so far. External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar paid a visit to London earlier this month amidst talk that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to visit India.

India has several trade deals on the table including the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Australia, FTA with the European Union, and a deal with the UK is expected to boost bilateral ties ahead of the election season in India. About the UK’s policy towards the trade deal with India, a British High Commission Spokesperson said, “We will only sign a deal that is fair, balanced, and ultimately in the best interests of the British people and the economy.”"

Tata Sons executive chairman N. Chandrasekaran said on Thursday that India is in a remarkable position and best placed towards transition in energy and other areas.

“If you take energy transition, probably we are the only country which is going to be investing in all these new energies like solar, hydrogen, wind...,” he said, speaking at an event to mark the 45th anniversary of PKF Sridhar & Santhanam LLP, a Chennai-based auditing firm.

“Every other economy has to add new energy to replace coal, which is tougher. So, for us, it is going to be an economic opportunity, a growth opportunity, and it will only accelerate and India will surpass everyone, irrespective of the deadlines,” he said.

As for electric vehicles, Mr. Chandrasekaran said, “I can only tell you that we will step on the gas. I fundamentally believe that the electric vehicle transition is here and it will happen faster than everyone is predicting. So many things, like charging infrastructure, has to happen, but they will happen.”

On artificial intelligence, he said mass adoption would happen only when factors such as processing power, storage cloud computing and mobile networks came together. He said there was a shift from predictive AI to generic AI and in future, it would move towards behavioural AI. On the AI front, he said India’s biggest strength is the digital infrastructure and the availability of young talent, and these would help leverage any new technology.

Mr. Chandrasekaran said, “We have a very strong opportunity to be part of global supply chain — be it electronics, defence, batteries, pharmaceuticals, among others.”

Mr. Chandrasekaran said the Tata Group is placing bets in all these areas. “We are in a period where we will have growth in domestic economy and export economy. We are going to have consumption-led growth and industrial growth. Despite arguments about what range our economic growth should be, the fundamental point is opportunities are huge.”

Santhanakrishnan S., chairman and managing partner, PKF Sridhar & Santhanam LLP, said that from the modest beginning in 1978, the firm had become an Indian multinational accounting firm and is working with marquee clients, including Tata Sons, Air India, Sanmar Group and Rane Group.

Ramakrishnan S., vice-chairman and managing partner, PKF Sridhar & Santhanam LLP, said the firm has a presence in 50 countries.

As efforts to rescue the 41 workers trapped inside the Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand go into the final phase, the Australian government says it is also watching closely, given that the engineer leading rescue efforts is an Australian expert, Arnold Dix.

“I am proud that Australia’s Professor Arnold Dix is providing important technical support on the ground to help evacuate the trapped workers,” Australian High Commissioner to India Phillip Green told The Hindu.

“My team has spoken to Dix and commended him on his ongoing contribution. My best wishes go to the Indian government’s rescue efforts,” he added, speaking on the sidelines of the Australia-India Leadership track 1.5 Dialogue organised by the Australia India Institute. The dialogue, which included the High Commissioner, High Commissioner of India to Australia Manpreet Vohra, Australian Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Tim Watts, former Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan as well as analysts, strategic experts and business leaders, held discussions on building strategic and economic cooperation, energy transitions and climate change resilience.

The rescue efforts for the workers who have been trapped deep inside the 4.5 km tunnel near Uttarkashi due to landslides since November 12 are being covered in Australian media as interest grows sharper in the fate of the workers. Dix, an Adjunct professor of engineering at Queensland University of Technology, who also practices law, is the President of the Switzerland-based 79-nation “International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association”. He has been camped at Silkyara since November 20 to assist rescue workers who have been battling the young and brittle mountainside as they try to build alternative tunnels through to the men trapped inside.

“Because we are up in the Himalayas, and the Himalayas are technically a very fresh mountain range, which means they’re falling apart,” Prof. Dix told the Australian Broadcast Corporation on November 23, after rescue efforts hit another snag, hitting steel girders as they tried to build the tunnel in.

“That means when you put a tunnel through, you’ve constantly got this risk that there’s going to be a collapse and so as engineers you’re fighting that risk,“ Mr. Dix added."

Against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual summit of G20 leaders on today which would be attended by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

With Ottawa confirming Mr. Trudeau's participation in the summit, this would be the first time he would come face to face with Prime Minister Modi, albeit virtually, after ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Mr. Trudeau's allegations in September of a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Nijjar on June 18 in British Columbia. India had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020. India has rejected Trudeau's allegations as ""absurd"" and ""motivated"".

While Mr. Putin's participation in the virtual meeting has also been confirmed by the Kremlin, China on Tuesday had announced that Premier Li Qiang will attend the virtual G20 Leaders' Summit at India's invitation.

Significantly, the meeting comes on a day Israel's Cabinet approved a temporary ceasefire with the Hamas group that is expected to bring the first halt in fighting in the six-week war.

The deal calls for a four-day ceasefire, during which Israel will halt its military offensive in Gaza while Hamas frees at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages it and other militants are holding, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office was quoted as saying by media reports.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday ahead of the summit, India's G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said the deliberations will witness ""excellent participation"" from leaders of the grouping.

Mr. Kant described the virtual summit as ""rare and exceptional"" which would give Modi an opportunity to interact with world leaders for a second time during India's G20 Presidency before it passes on to Brazil in December.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin had skipped the G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10.

""The virtual summit of the G20 being held tomorrow will also be a major gathering of world leaders since the conclusion of the 78th Session of the UN General Assembly and the SDG Summit,"" Mr. Kant had said.

Noting that several challenges have emerged since the September G20 summit, Mr. Kant had said development would be the primary focus of the virtual meeting and leaders might engage in discussions on a myriad of other issues.

""We are expecting a large majority of G20 leaders to be present,"" said Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra in response to questions.

He said it would not be correct to pre-judge if the issues of geo-political tensions will be raised at the meeting.

The virtual meeting of G20 leaders is taking place a day after leaders of the BRICS grouping held an extraordinary meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

""The virtual summit will provide an opportunity not only to discuss the implementation of the leaders' declaration but also for the leaders to share views and enhance cooperation on critical challenges,"" Mr. Kant had said.

He said the goal was to address gaps in global governance, reaffirm commitments to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and progress toward a revitalised multilateral system better positioned to positively impact people's lives.

Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth had said it is expected that today’s meeting will give further momentum and guidance on issues related to the finance track and then hand it over to Brazil which will take over the G20 presidency from December 1.

The meeting will deliberate on a host of issues but all eyes are on the deliberations related to the Gaza situation.

Israel has been carrying out a massive military operation in Gaza following the unprecedented and multi-pronged attacks on Israeli cities by Hamas militants on October 7. Hamas killed around 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 220 others. Around 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli offensive, according to the Hamas-run authorities in Gaza.

There has been mounting criticism of Israel for the death of a large number of civilians, including women and children, in Gaza in its military operations."

Argentine President-elect Javier Milei ran his campaign on promises to ditch the peso for the U.S. dollar and do away with a central bank — all in the name of subduing rampant inflation.

The far-right outsider is hoping to rein in inflation that has hit 140%, bedevilling the South American country as it struggles with a deep economic crisis.

Editorial | Leap in the dark: On the election of Javier Milei, in Argentina

Several Latin American countries have already officially or unofficially dollarised their economies, hoping to usher in new eras of economic and financial stability that could not be achieved using their own currencies.

Ecuador adopted the dollar in March 2000, hoping to shake off a profound banking crisis that had caused $5 billion in losses and left thousands of people bankrupt. The ensuing price increases threatened to accelerate into runaway hyperinflation.

Emergency steps

The transition from the sucre to the dollar came after a bank holiday coupled with a temporary freeze to half of all deposits — emergency steps that seemed to work. Inflation levels came down rapidly, with Ecuador sometimes even veering into periods of deflation. The country’s 2023 annual inflation is expected to sit at 3.1%.

The dollar became the official currency of El Salvador on January 1, 2001. The government of then-President Francisco Flores argued the changeover would make the country more attractive to foreign investments and trade, plus reduce the risk of devaluation and allow local banks to provide better credit offers. But “dollarisation had adverse effects,” according to independent economist Cesar Villalona.

The dollarisation process in Venezuela has been more informal.

U.S. dollars — a symbol of “American imperialism” — have paradoxically become the most-circulated currency in Venezuela, according to economists.

In some Latin American countries such as Peru and Uruguay, the dollar is used to pay for certain consumer goods and services and U.S. bills can be withdrawn from ATMs and used to open bank accounts, even though the official currency for government affairs remains fixed in local money."

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das on November 22 said the recent tightening of norms on unsecured lending is a pre-emptive and targeted move in the interest of sustainability.

Addressing the annual FIBAC event in Mumbai, he said the RBI excluded certain sections such as loans for house and vehicle purchase, and also the ones availed by small businesses, because of the advantage on the growth front they have.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) are jointly organising the FIBAC event.

""We have also recently announced a few macroprudential measures in the overall interest of sustainability. These measures are pre-emptive in nature. They are calibrated and targeted,"" Mr. Das said.

Mr. Das said he does not see new stress building up in the banking system currently, but wants lenders to continue with stress testing.

He said some non-bank finance companies-microfinance institutions (NBFC-MFIs) are reporting higher interest margins and asked them to use the flexibility in setting rates by the RBI ""judiciously"".

Meanwhile, even as the headline inflation is showing signs of cooling, Mr. Das said RBI is completely focussed on price rise.

“The Indian Rupee has exhibited “low volatility and orderly movements” despite the elevated U.S. treasury yields,” Mr. Das said in the comments that come amid some depreciation in the local currency to newer lows.

He also pitched for reforms in agricultural marketing and connected value chains for sustained high growth, durable price stability and mitigating price shocks."

China may help Fiji develop its ports and shipyards, the Pacific island country's Prime Minister said on November 22, raising the prospect of stronger ties with Beijing in a key area of its economy.

Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who has been cautious about China's expanding security footprint in the Pacific, praised Beijing's record of aid to Fiji in fighting COVID-19, developing agriculture and revamping infrastructure.

The modernisation of Fiji's port facilities and shipyards is a ""key focus"" for sustainable economic development, Mr. Rabuka told Parliament after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.

""I anticipate potential collaboration with China in that endeavour,"" the Fijian leader said, citing the Asian giant's ""globally competitive shipbuilding"" capacity.

Fiji and other Pacific nations have sought to strike a delicate balance as China competes for influence in the region with the U.S. and its allies.

Mr. Xi pledged to help Fiji safeguard its ""security and sovereignty"" and to cooperate on infrastructure when he met with Rabuka on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic summit in San Francisco, China's foreign ministry said last week.

During a visit to Australia last month, Mr. Rabuka said he preferred dealing with democratic ""traditional friends"" when asked about China's security role in the South Pacific.

Mr. Rabuka has also advocated the creation of a ""zone of peace"" in the region.

China notably alarmed Western countries when it signed a secretive defence pact with Solomon Islands last year, sparking fears it could deploy military forces there.

Asked about the Fijian leader's comments, Beijing described the two countries as ""good friends and partners"".

""The two countries have carried out practical cooperation in various fields, including infrastructure, to boost Fiji's economic and social development,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.

Beijing ""is committed to helping the island nations realise livelihood revitalisation and development improvement"", she added."

The Indian economy has an incomes problem, not a growth problem. Incomes are not growing sufficiently or sustainably for very large numbers of people. Even though overall GDP growth is good, there is increasing pressure for reservations of jobs for all “economically weaker” sections regardless of caste or religion.

Economists on both sides, for the government and those against it, are debating whether the economy is creating enough jobs and are questioning the veracity of the government’s data. Those against the government also want to show that the problem of growth with insufficient jobs has been created by the policies of the present government and not the previous one. They are like Sheikh Chilli, who was looking for his lost keys under the lamp, rather than in the darkness where he lost them. The data is what they can see, but it cannot explain the problem, and will not point to the right solutions.

The U.S. economy

The U.S. economy seems to be doing well according to its headline economic numbers. Growth is good and employment numbers have been improving. Yet, polls show that a large majority of U.S. citizens are dissatisfied with the state of their economy. This has become a major issue before the presidential elections, scheduled for next November. The U.S. President even walked with striking autoworkers demanding a fair deal from their employers. U.S. statistics of growth and employment, whose veracity no one doubts, are not measuring what really matters to common citizens. Workers want a fair deal and adequate and secure incomes to cope with inflation. The President agreed with the workers that CEOs of auto companies were paying themselves far too much while asking workers to tighten their belts to improve the competitiveness of U.S. companies.

Jobs that are not ‘good’

The overall problem of incomes in India, according to economists, is that insufficient numbers have moved out of agriculture into manufacturing. This has been the historical pattern for sustainable growth in all countries, including the U.S. a hundred years ago, and China more recently. India’s policymakers thought they had found a short-cut in the 1990s, directly from agriculture to services, with the boost in the growth of exportable Information Technology services. The short-cut has ended in a cul-de-sac. There is very little room in high-end services to absorb the large numbers of young Indians in need of jobs. Moreover, these jobs require levels of education that people in rural areas do not have. Therefore, when they move out of agriculture, they need work that fits their present abilities, and puts them onto a ladder that they can climb. They need jobs where they can learn higher skills and earn more. Labour-intensive manufacturing, services, and construction provide them the first step. The millions of Indians who have moved out of agriculture in the last three decades moved into such jobs.

The problem is that the jobs they have, irrespective of the sector, are not “good” jobs: they do not pay enough, they are temporary or on short contracts, and they do not provide social security or assistance to develop further skills. In fact, even in large, modern, manufacturing enterprises, workers are employed through contractors to provide employers with “flexibility” to reduce costs. Contract workers are paid much less than regular workers. They have insecure employment and are not assisted to develop higher skills.

The world is at a turning point. New ideas of economics are required to create a more environmentally sustainable and socially harmonious future before it is too late. Statistics of growth and employment measure what we used to think should be measured. New concepts of “work” are required; also new designs of enterprises in which the work is done; as well as new evaluations of the social and economic relationships between participants in these enterprises. The drive for green, organic, and “local” to reduce carbon emissions and improve care of the environment will make small enterprises beautiful again. “Economies of scope” will determine the viability of enterprises rather than “economies of scale”. Denser, local, economic webs will develop, rather than long, global supply chains through which specialised products made on scale in different parts of the world are connecting producers with consumers in other distant parts.

The economic value in caregiving

Attention will shift towards creating genuine “social” enterprises, rather than enterprises for creating economic efficiencies and surpluses which corporate enterprises are designed for. Those who provide care, and their work of caregiving, must be valued more than economists value them today. In the present paradigm of economic growth, caregivers, traditionally women, are plucked out of families — which are a natural social enterprise — to work in factories, offices, and retail, in enterprises designed to produce monetary economic value. When economists measure women’s participation in the labour force, they value only what women do in formal enterprises for money. They seem to assign no value to the “informal” work they do outside their homes to earn money, whether as domestic caregivers in others’ homes or on family farms. Moreover, they are unable to see any economic value in the caregiving they provide without monetary compensation in their families and communities.

The prevalent paradigm of economic theory is distorting social organisations, which families are, to suit the requirements of corporations, which are formal economic organisations. Thus, the money-measured economy (GDP) grows, while the care that humans can and should give each other reduces. Measurements of economic growth and employment must not be mired any longer in 20th-century concepts of economic growth. They must be reformed to reflect forms of work and enterprises we want more of in the future.

For this paradigm shift, the process of policymaking must begin with listening to those who have not been given much value in the present economic paradigm: to workers, small-holding farmers, small entrepreneurs, and women. Presently, their views are over-ruled by those who have power in the present paradigm: experts in economics, large financial institutions, and large business corporations. The lesson for policymakers is this. Don’t count on historical statistics to guide good policy for the future: listen to the people and what matters to them.

Despite Sri Lankan laws prohibiting bottom trawling and illegal fishing by foreign vessels, Indian fishing trawlers continue to poach in the island’s northern seas without facing legal consequences for the violation, according to fisher leaders from the island’s Northern Province.

Addressing a media conference in Colombo on Wednesday, they accused Sri Lankan authorities of swiftly releasing arrested Indian fishermen, without adhering to the law. “It is as if there is no consequence for poaching. They are arrested and released within days, while our livelihoods are getting destroyed,” said A. Annarasa, leader of a Jaffna-based fishermen’s federation.

His remarks come days after the Sri Lankan government released 22 fishermen from Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, who were detained by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of trespassing on November 18. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is said to have intervened, to expedite the release of the arrested Tamil Nadu fishermen.

“We read in the media that the Indian Minister made a request and our President [Ranil Wickremesinghe] released them. Then why do we need laws or regulations? This only shows that neither government cares about us,” Mr. Annarasa said, voicing frustration over an enduring problem.

For well over a decade now, fishing communities from Sri Lanka’s war-affected region have been relentlessly highlighting the destructive impact of Indian trawlers engaging in illegal fishing along their coastline. The fishing vessels, originating in Tamil Nadu, use the bottom-trawling method which indiscriminately scoops out marine organisms, resulting in a drastic fall fish production over time.

Fisherfolk from northern Sri Lanka have participated in several rounds of bilateral talks, besides agitating frequently, with the demand that the two countries arrive at a durable solution to the problem that threatens marine biodiversity in the Palk Strait. Although India and Sri Lanka in 2016 agreed to “expedite the transition towards ending the practice of bottom trawling at the earliest”, there has been no respite in these six years. Further, Sri Lanka banned bottom trawling in 2017 and introduced stiff fines in 2018 to deter foreign vessels, but that has not proved an effective deterrent. This year alone, a total of 164 Indian fishermen were arrested in Sri Lanka’s northern seas on charges of poaching. A total of 115 have been repatriated already, and more releases are likely this week, according to official sources.

Recently, Sri Lanka’s Fisheries Ministry has warned of tough action against owners of foreign boats found trespassing. However, the fisher leaders remain sceptical, citing “poor implementation” of laws on the ground.

Several blows

Meanwhile, the island’s fishing community has also had to cope with the pandemic and the island’s painful economic crash that led to a steep increase in fuel prices, pressuring fishermen who were already suffering huge losses.

The Sri Lankan government offered no meaningful relief to the fishing community in the latest Budget and further, is amending fisheries laws to make way for multinational corporations to operate in the sector, the fishermen said.

“If our own government has forgotten us, India is focussing only on countering China in our country, including the north. Our own brothers in Tamil Nadu are also not appreciating our plight. We feel abandoned by all sides,” said N.V. Subramaniam, a senior fisher leader from Jaffna.

Last year, Sri Lankan fishing community leaders wrote to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, seeking a “progressive” solution to the fisheries conflict affecting fisherfolk both Tamil Nadu and war-hit northern Sri Lanka. “Every time Tamil Nadu fishermen are arrested by the Navy here, the media in Tamil Nadu frames it as a conflict between the Sri Lankan Navy and their fishermen. It is in fact Tamil fishermen on this side who are most affected in this. They cannot continue ignoring that truth,” said Mohamed Alam, a fisher leader from Mannar.

The rise of China, and its assertiveness, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, has shaped the relationship between India and the U.S. in various sectors such as technology, manufacturing, defence and environment, former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said on Wednesday.

Speaking on ‘India’s place in the changing world’ at the Luminary Lecture Series organised by the Christian Medical College (CMC), Ms. Rao said that areas between the eastern coast of Africa and western coast of the U.S., referred to as the Indo-Pacific region, were where many countries, including India and the U.S., had high stakes. Unlike what was the case two decades ago, China had been more assertive in the region in recent years, she said. “Be it on the land or in the maritime sector, China seeks sovereign rights in some of the disputed areas, including islands in the region (Indo-Pacific region), and that affects east and southeast Asian countries. The collaboration between India and the U.S. in various fields is also based on China’s assertiveness,” she said.

China’s assertiveness had made it difficult to resolve the border dispute between India and China. This was evident after the skirmishes at Galwan Valley in Ladakh in June 2020, where the two armies fought and lost lives. The consequence of it was that the edifice of confidence of both countries had collapsed, she said. “Despite improving trade relations between the two countries from $3 billion in 2003 to $118 billion in 2023, the inbuilt weakness of the two countries has remained. As a result, only a small quotient of mutual trust exists between the two countries,” the former diplomat said.

Supporting the stand taken by India on its right to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the seasoned diplomat said India had the credentials to make a claim for a permanent seat at the UNSC for various reasons, including the fact that India was the largest democracy with a young population; and it was also the fifth largest economy in the world with a target of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 and a developed nation by 2047. “Many of our friends and partners like the U.S. acknowledge it. We are the voice of the developing nations. However, there is a lot of ground to be covered to achieve it, as there is no consensus for the expansion of UNSC,” she said.

Ms. Rao said India’s role in the world was changing, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, as the country was able to provide vaccines to many developing countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean at a low cost. The ‘vaccine diplomacy’ by India had saved millions of lives during the pandemic in these countries. It had helped change the view of India among developing nations, she said. “They (developing countries, especially in Africa and Latin America) started to believe in the work done by India during the pandemic. It was an independent role played by India than its usual non-aligned one,” she said.

The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) has authorised the Eutelsat OneWeb constellation to enable the provisioning of its capacity in India for providing communication services. OneWeb India is part of the Bharti Group, which operates Airtel, and subsidiary of Eutelsat Group.

M/s OneWeb India Communication Private Limited (OneWeb India) is the first company that has been authorised by IN-SPACe to enable the provisioning of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation capacity in the country.

OneWeb India aims to provide internet services to the rural and unconnected areas and territorial waters of India on a 24 x 7 basis.

The Eutelsat OneWeb is a global constellation with 648 satellites (including spares) orbiting Earth in circular polar orbits at 1200 km altitude and shall provide about 21 Gbps throughput over India.

“IN-SPACe authorisation to the Eutelsat OneWeb constellation has a validity period of five years and is subject to the assignment of the spectrum by the Department of Telecommunication for both the gateways and user terminal operations, and other requisite regulating licenses and approvals in this regard,”IN-SPACe said.

IN-SPACe, which is an autonomous nodal agency under the Department of Space to promote, enable, authorise and supervise non-government entities to undertake space activities, added that it believes that these new birds in the sky shall blanket India with low latency, high throughput capacity and shall contribute towards bridging the digital divide in the urban and rural/remote India.

OneWeb India said that this development adds to Eutelsat OneWeb’s existing strong position in the Indian market, where OneWeb India already holds the necessary licences from the Department of Telecommunications to provide broadband services using satellite connectivity.

“The business has also obtained in principle approval to establish and operate two gateways in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, which would secure the provision of vital high-speed, low-latency internet connectivity to customers across India, once services are rolled out,” it said."
47,The Hindu,How the BJP juggernaut chugs along - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/how-the-bjp-juggernaut-chugs-along/article67557918.ece,,"November 22, 2023 12:15 am | Updated 10:19 am IST

Unlike the first spell of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has consciously anchored itself to a deeper foundation of political legitimacy, beyond the prosaic imperatives of holding on to political power. Over the last decade, the wider political culture of the country has undergone a thorough process of making and un-making. The political scholar and activist, Yogendra Yadav, had provocatively captured this palpable phenomenon as the “unveiling of the second Indian republic”. There are, of course, scholarly disputes about the nature and extent of such stated political transformation. In the midst of a crucial round of State elections, and before the national elections, one might revisit certain questions afresh.

BJP dominant or Modi dominant?

First, can the present political system be characterised as a dominant party system; and if so, can it be more accurately characterised as a BJP dominant system or a Narendra Modi dominant system? Second, how robust and sustainable does the present structure of political dominance appear from a historical perspective? Some political scientists, such as Adam Ziegfeld, have articulated reasonable doubts over the BJP’s claims to dominance. They say that unlike the Congress’s geographical spread under Indira Gandhi, the BJP’s spread still substantially excludes southern and eastern India. The much-vaunted BJP electoral machine has been unable to dislodge a regional incumbent in State elections outside of the so-called Hindi belt. At present, the party does not possess a State government in any southern State and in a large swathe of eastern India (Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha). Also, unlike the Congress under Jawaharlal Nehru, the NDA has also not fulfilled the gruelling test of regime longevity (a rough rule of thumb being three consecutive terms).

Editorial | Roadblocks to unity: On the INDIA bloc

Nevertheless, few might contest the fact that the present majority coalition led by the BJP commands more robust popular support than what the Congress enjoyed in the latter half of the 1980s under Rajiv Gandhi. Between 1985 and 1990, the Congress suffered dramatic reversals in its previous strongholds of Assam, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. In the words of the political scientists Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph, the rise of regional parties in crucial States and the consequent de-legitimisation of the old centralised Congress system had “reduced Congress’ ability to win the super-majorities that had enabled it to be [the] dominant party for so long”. Thus, the Rudolphs held the 1989 election loss as both anticipated and much in line with a broader trend of party decline caused by the “cancer of party de-institutionalisation, launched by Indira Gandhi, and not addressed by Rajiv Gandhi”.

In contrast, one can gauge sharp discontinuities and ambiguities in the political picture gleaned from this round of State elections. While the BJP appears to be struggling in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana, and hardly appears to be decisively ahead in Rajasthan, a State known for its ‘revolving door’ trend, a heavy dose of caution is warranted before extrapolating this to a national trend.

In 2019, the BJP’s victory had largely rested on landslides in north, west, and central India, often exceeding a stupefying 50% vote share. A recent CVoter survey asked voters of poll-bound States to rate their satisfaction with the work done under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. In Rajasthan, 60% claimed to be very satisfied, with 17.4% exhibiting no satisfaction. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, there were high levels of satisfaction with the national government (roughly 58% each) and low levels of strong dissatisfaction (22% and 17%, respectively).

This is a far cry from the last years of the Rajiv Gandhi government, when the tumultuous Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the onward march of the rural-centric Other Backward Classes (OBC) parties had resulted in the evisceration of public support for the Congress in northern and central India. The present phase bears no similarity to the 1988-89 period, when the Congress coalition was reeling under allegations of corruption, declining support, and intra-party tussles.

Absence of strong State leaders

Arguably, however, the over-centralised nature of the BJP party machinery has weakened State units, reminiscent of the follies of the Congress of an earlier era. The BJP’s reversals in several State elections in recent years stem in large part from the absence of strong, credible leaders. This weakness of State leadership is partly a result of the lack of intra-party space afforded to powerful State leaders such as Shivraj Chouhan, Vasundhara Raje, and Raman Singh.

Editorial | A lot in a name: On INDIA and the BJP

Combing through data from past surveys of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies and Axis My India, the political analyst Amitabh Tiwari recently sought to quantify the ‘Modi factor’ in national versus State elections. In national elections, Mr. Modi’s leadership was claimed to be a decisive factor in the BJP vote by a large section (roughly between one-quarter and one-third of all respondents in the last two elections). However, in almost every State election, only around 5% explained the Modi effect as a vote choice (the only exception being Uttar Pradesh where it was reported to be a decisive factor for 10.2% of respondents). According to the political scientist Atul Kohli, Rajiv Gandhi had harmed his own party by hoarding political capital within his own charismatic leadership, and not divesting decision-making power to State-level leaders. Thus, Rajiv Gandhi had failed to institutionalise political support within the structures of the Congress party organisation. Can a similar fate befall the BJP under the centralised reign of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah?

The indefatigable BJP engine

It is hard to provide any pre-determined answer to that question. This is because, as this writer had argued two years ago (along with the political scientist Rahul Verma), the present BJP system of dominance can be more accurately defined as a BJP dominant system rather than a Modi dominant system. In other words, more of an ideologically pre-figured ethnic-majoritarian coalition rather than one based on any singular charismatic personality. One can provide two pieces of supportive evidence from the present configuration of the political dynamics at large.

The first is the lack of a clear ideological alternative provided by the Congress in States where it is in a straight contest with the BJP. In this round of State elections, the State Congress leadership (particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) has consciously anchored itself to (and thus again legitimised) the ideological mainstream of Hindu nationalism. Indeed, Congress stalwart Kamal Nath declared in as many words that India is already a de facto Hindu Rashtra. This proves that the BJP has established itself not just through the remoulding of institutional arrangements, but also through the decisive charting out of the dominant ideological mainstream. This unchallenged Hindutva-inflected political culture has contributed in large part to the sustenance of the Modi charisma. Second, conflict is bubbling under the surface of the INDIA coalition between Mandal parties and the Congress. These two political forces together comprise the primary opponent to the BJP in almost half of all national seats. Their latent (and sometimes open) conflict testifies to the many constraints thwarting efforts to fuse together a coherent ideological platform, particularly on thorny issues such as sharing political ownership of the caste census agenda. The intensity of these skirmishes are liable to increase with (potentially) a growing realisation of being dragged into a zero-sum fight over a stagnant pool of the anti-BJP vote.

Moreover, the Opposition shows a lack of political imagination in connecting welfare promises and caste-based slogans to the larger questions of the political economy. Both the BJP’s and Congress’ socio-economic agendas often appear to be an undistinguishable potpourri of ‘freebies’ and ‘handouts. Thus, though support may be frayed around the edges, the engine of BJP dominance chugs along, still powered by its long-gestated ideological steam.

Inflationary pressures in the Indian economy have moderated but price rise remains a key risk to growth along with external financial flows that could affect the rupee’s value and the balance of payments situation, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.

Asserting that the economy had been remarkably resilient amid a global slowdown, the ministry said private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) had emerged as the strongest driver of growth so far this year. While domestic demand had been solid, a fuller transmission of monetary policy may temper demand, the ministry said in its monthly economic review for October.

Exuding confidence that the Centre was on track to achieve the budgeted fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP for the current financial year, the ministry added: “The recent steep and rapid decline in global crude oil prices removes an important source of potential impact on public finances as well.”

The rapid reversal of rate hike expectations in the U.S. and the slide in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, coupled with the decline in oil prices, was good news for emerging markets in general, India included. However, the ‘priced to perfection’ U.S. stocks continue to be a source of potential risk for global stocks, the ministry cautioned.

“Rural demand has sustained sequential momentum” in the July to September quarter, the ministry noted, attributing it to stable incomes from foodgrain production and moderating inflationary pressures. “At the same time, increasing production and expansion in sales have been driving growth in the manufacturing sector. Services activity has also been expanding, driven by favourable demand conditions and a strong influx of new businesses,” it said.

“The festive season has further strengthened consumption demand. While accumulated savings and declining rates of unemployment constitute the underlying strength of consumption demand, the wealth effect emanating from rising real estate prices and growing capitalisation of equity markets may have also strengthened consumption,” it added."

The Indian economy is expected to grow by 7% in the second quarter, surpassing the central bank’s estimate of a 6.5% uptick, rating agency ICRA said on Tuesday, citing improved industrial performance despite a weak monsoon hitting the farm sector.

India’s real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and Gross Value Added (GVA) had grown 7.8% in the April to June 2023 quarter. ICRA expects the GVA growth to ease to 6.8% in the July to September quarter, with the services sector’s GVA expected to rise 8.2%, from 10.3% in Q1, and industry reflecting a 6.6% rise. Farm sector GVA growth is expected to slow to 1% from 3.5% in the first quarter.

“A normalising base and an erratic monsoon are expected to result in a sequential moderation in the GDP growth to 7.0% in Q2 from 7.8% in Q1,” ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said. “Regardless, we anticipate that the GDP expansion in this quarter will exceed the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) October 2023 projection of 6.5%,” she added.

“Looking ahead, uneven rainfall, narrowing differentials with year-ago commodity prices, the possible slowdown in momentum of Government capex as we approach the Parliamentary Elections, weak external demand and the cumulative impact of monetary tightening are likely to translate into lower GDP growth in H2 FY2024. As a result, we maintain our 2023-24 GDP growth estimate at 6.0%, lower than the MPC’s projection of 6.5% for the fiscal.”"

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on November 22 announced a number of new policies to increase exports, modernise logistics and promote renewable energy manufacturing in the State but could not refrain from mixing business with politics at the inauguration of seventh edition of Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS).

Ms. Banerjee also announced that former Indian Cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, who was present at the business summit, will be the Brand Ambassador of the State. A few months ago Mr. Ganguly was nominated as Brand Ambassador for Tripura tourism. Tripura is run by a Bharatiya Janata Party government.

“There is only one tax in the country, the Central government collects and gives the States their share. I am sorry to say, I should not mention all this. Please excuse me for saying this but we are not getting our share,” the Chief Minister said in presence of captains of industry as well as delegates from 17 countries. Ms. Banerjee added that wages of MGNREGA workers have not been released by the Centre.

Reliance Industries chairperson Mukesh Ambani, energy baron Sanjeev Goenka and Wipro’s Rishad Premji, were among those who were present at the event. The seventh edition of BGBS was an opportunity for the West Bengal government to showcase achievements in the business sector ahead of the Lok sabha polls. The Chief Minister tried to impress upon the gathering that communal harmony prevails in the State and her government does not believe in divide and rule policy. “There is a rumour that Bengal is a place of violence. This is a narrative of some political parties,” she said.

Among the other major announcements the Chief Minister announced a policy to promote bio-fuels and a new sub-sea cable landing station at Digha to help improve internet connectivity in the eastern region.

Ms. Banerjee said that West Bengal’s economy was growing at 8.41% and its GDP would touch $212 billion this fiscal. Touching on the major infrastructure projects in the State, the Chief Minister spoke of setting up four new industrial corridors that would be set up including the Dankuni-Kalyani, corridor Deep Sea Port at Tajpur and Deocha Pachami Coal mines.

She also added that at the last six editions of BGBS, proposals amounting to $190 billion have been received, and projects worth $121 billion have already been launched or are at various stages of implementation.

Ms. Banerjee also highlighted several social sector schemes of her government like Kanyashree which provides cash support to school going girls and Lakshmir Bhandar that provides cash incentives to women."

Although India and Sri Lanka in 2016 agreed to “expedite the transition towards ending the practice of bottom trawling at the earliest”, there has been no respite in these six years. Further, Sri Lanka banned bottom trawling in 2017 and introduced stiff fines in 2018 to deter foreign vessels, but that has not proved an effective deterrent. This year alone, a total of 164 Indian fishermen were arrested in Sri Lanka’s northern seas on charges of poaching. A total of 115 have been repatriated already, and more releases are likely this week, according to official sources.

Recently, Sri Lanka’s Fisheries Ministry has warned of tough action against owners of foreign boats found trespassing. However, the fisher leaders remain sceptical, citing “poor implementation” of laws on the ground.

Several blows

Meanwhile, the island’s fishing community has also had to cope with the pandemic and the island’s painful economic crash that led to a steep increase in fuel prices, pressuring fishermen who were already suffering huge losses.

The Sri Lankan government offered no meaningful relief to the fishing community in the latest Budget and further, is amending fisheries laws to make way for multinational corporations to operate in the sector, the fishermen said.

“If our own government has forgotten us, India is focussing only on countering China in our country, including the north. Our own brothers in Tamil Nadu are also not appreciating our plight. We feel abandoned by all sides,” said N.V. Subramaniam, a senior fisher leader from Jaffna.

Last year, Sri Lankan fishing community leaders wrote to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, seeking a “progressive” solution to the fisheries conflict affecting fisherfolk both Tamil Nadu and war-hit northern Sri Lanka. “Every time Tamil Nadu fishermen are arrested by the Navy here, the media in Tamil Nadu frames it as a conflict between the Sri Lankan Navy and their fishermen. It is in fact Tamil fishermen on this side who are most affected in this. They cannot continue ignoring that truth,” said Mohamed Alam, a fisher leader from Mannar.

54,The Hindu,ASEAN wants India to join RCEP for greater market access ...,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/asean-wants-india-to-join-rcep-for-greater-market-access-secretary-general-kao/article67557068.ece,,"November 21, 2023 01:17 pm | Updated 01:17 pm IST - Jakarta

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary-General Dr. Kao Kim Hourn has said that the 10-member bloc of the Southeast Asian countries wants India to join the landmark Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) for greater market access as he asserted that all partners stand to gain from the inclusive, open and rule-based trade pact.

Dr. Kao also said India and ASEAN have been working together across various sectors — from space to investment, to tourism, to the defence sector and counter-terrorism, among others — and advocated expanding such cooperation in new sectors.

Talking to a select group of Indian journalists in Jakarta on Monday evening (November 20), Dr. Kao said joining the RCEP would benefit India as the agreement would provide greater market access. He added that all partners will gain from the inclusive, open and rule-based trade pact.

The RCEP is a free trade area (FTA) consisting of 10 ASEAN members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam) and five of the bloc's dialogue partners — China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

The landmark agreement was signed in November 2020. Together, these RCEP participating countries account for about 30% of the global GDP and 30% of the world population.

India had pulled out of the RCEP as, according to officials, joining it would have resulted in fairly negative consequences for the country's economy.

“Looking ahead, of course, we hope to continue to expand the existing areas of cooperation and also to deepen our cooperation,” he said, suggesting collaboration in the biotech sector, public health facility, renewable energy sector, people-to-people exchange, connectivity and in many other areas.”

“We stand to benefit from the partnership between ASEAN and India. At the moment, we have many mechanisms for cooperation between the two sides,” he added.

Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jakarta in September to attend the ASEAN summit, he said the grouping “highly value” its ""partnership” with India.

""We were delighted to welcome Prime Minister Modi to Jakarta, where he participated in the ASEAN India Summit. And we highly value our partnership with India,"" he said.

During the Summit on September 7 in Jakarta, Prime Minister Modi presented a 12-point proposal to expand cooperation between India and ASEAN in a range of areas such as connectivity, trade and digital transformation even as he called for building a rules-based post-COVID world order.

The Prime Minister had reaffirmed that ASEAN is the central pillar of India's Act East Policy and it fully supports ASEAN centrality and its outlook on the Indo-Pacific.

Dr. Kao said that ASEAN is a maritime community and India is a maritime nation. ""We can collaborate in the maritime sector, for example, maritime cooperation, which is one of the four priority areas under the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Also (we can) work together in the digital economy and sustainability, in the renewable energy sector and people-to-people exchanges and connectivity.""

Dr. Kao also talked about the contributions of ASEAN-India dialogue relations to ASEAN’s community-building efforts and underscored the important role of media in encouraging greater cooperation between ASEAN and India, especially in the areas of cultural exchanges, connectivity and people-to-people ties, among others.

He advocated a liberal aviation pact that would facilitate more direct flights between India and ASEAN nations and enhance people-to-people ties and boost tourism.

Responding to a question on conflicts in various parts of the world, Dr. Kao said that ASEAN is a strong proponent of peace, dialogue and diplomacy.

“ASEAN has always been promoting a culture of dialogue, habits of consultation, and of course constructive engagement,” he said, adding that things should be worked out through dialogue and the non-use of force.

He hoped that the United Nations would play a constructive role in the resolution of the ongoing conflicts around the world.

“We hope that the United Nations will play a constructive role in ongoing conflicts around the world. We believe that the UN has the means and of course, the commitment to work toward the resolution of the conflicts, particularly when we see a humanitarian tragedy unfolding before us,"" he said, referring to the Israel-Palestine conflict. ASEAN wants “peace should be given a chance”, he added.

The ASEAN is considered one of the most influential groupings in the region and India and several other countries including the U.S., China, Japan and Australia are its dialogue partners.

ASEAN-India dialogue relations started with the establishment of a sectoral partnership in 1992. This graduated to a full dialogue partnership in December 1995 and a summit-level partnership in 2002. The ties were elevated to a strategic partnership in 2012.

The 10 member countries of ASEAN are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia."
55,The Hindu,Making sense of the employment challenge - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/making-sense-of-the-employment-challenge/article67555366.ece,,"November 21, 2023 12:50 am | Updated 11:04 am IST

By proposing that Indians work longer to achieve a larger national output, N.R. Narayana Murthy, the founder of India’s iconic business house, Infosys, has issued something akin to a challenge to his compatriots. In particular, he proposed a 70-hour work week. To strengthen his case he has pointed to the experience of Japan and Germany after the Second World War, when citizens worked longer hours than we do on average in India today. It is indeed correct that these countries had a miraculous rise in the 1950s, but is the comparison valid? Can Indians simply choose to work longer hours to replicate their experience? This is not obvious.

Output, demand and labour

Ever since the Keynesian Revolution in economics, we know that output is determined by aggregate demand, which is the demand for the total volume of goods and services produced in an economy. The demand for labour is entirely dependent upon this demand. There is no demand for labour independent of the demand for goods. Firms that employ more labour while aggregate demand has not increased will find themselves with unsold goods. So, an offer by workers to work longer hours will not ensure that they will find employment so long as firms are unwilling to hire them.

Firms are guided by the profit motive and will employ more labour only if there is increased demand for their product. Unemployment reflects just that — workers willing to work but firms unwilling to employ them for it would be unprofitable for them. The role of demand for goods and services in determining the demand for labour may be seen in the lay-offs in the ‘tech’ sector globally at the beginning of this year. Since then, Google and Amazon have shed hundreds of employees hired during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the demand for their products was high due to the lockdown or the work-from-home arrangement. In a variant of the ‘just in time’ strategy, whereby manufacturing firms are hesitant to hold an inventory of materials for long, software services companies (a segment Mr. Narayana Murthy is no doubt familiar with) optimise the number of employees ‘on the bench’, i.e., waiting to be deployed in production. So, when there is unemployment, to exhort workers to work longer hours is somewhat irrelevant, even when it is not meant to be callous.

Now, what about Germany and Japan in the early post-War years? Actually, nothing demonstrates the role of the demand for labour services being a crucial determinant of hours worked than the history of these economies. Their economies were pulverised by the relentless bombing during the Second World War. They had also experienced a decline in their workforces due to greater mortality, both from combat and the bombing. So, when it came to rebuilding these economies, the demand for labour was abnormally high. Minimally, prior to the resumption of production, the cities would have had to be cleared of rubble — a task requiring massive deployment of labour given the scale of the devastation. It is also necessary to keep in mind where the financial heft for the expansion of employment came from. In the case of west Germany, there was the Marshall Plan by which the United States had assisted the country’s revival. If it had been insisted that the post-war recovery of Europe had to be confined to private enterprise, the revival would surely have taken far longer. In fact, it was out of an astute assessment of what private initiative could have achieved in the context that the World Bank, funded by western governments, was set up. So, the very high working hours clocked in post-war economies of the mid-20th century is sui generis.

The case of South Korea

Though it was not mentioned by Mr. Narayana Murthy, another economy that saw long working hours in this period was South Korea. Some of its features are similar to those that had prevailed in Germany and Japan then. It too was recovering from a war, though a different one, and its resurgence was supported by considerable foreign aid received from the U.S., of which it was an ally. However, a political aspect beyond finance, common to all these three countries, is a strong nationalistic element that is likely to have accompanied their post-war reconstruction. It is not inconceivable that there was a voluntary supply of effort to rebuild the nation after a shared catastrophe imposed by ‘foreigners’.

There was an additional dimension in Korea though — a dictatorship that saw the commandeering of able-bodied men to work in the countryside on large-scale projects of preparing the land for raising agricultural productivity. There is insufficient recognition of the fact that the manufacturing success of the east is underpinned by prior success in agriculture. The high working hours that contributed to this are unlikely to have been witnessed in a system in which labour was allocated according to consideration of profit. The case of high working hours in Germany and East Asia in the middle of the last century, backed by public funding and coercion, is not an experience helpful to understanding the present in India (a market economy where firms are driven by consideration of profit and coercion is ruled out). In the economic rise of the three countries mentioned, it was post-war reconstruction that provided the demand for greater output in the first instance. Longer workdays had followed.

Economic strategies for India

Does it mean, then, that there is an iron law of the market pinning us down helplessly to high unemployment through low aggregate demand in India? Not at all. There are two strategies economic policy here can attempt. The first is to use the global market or world demand to grow the domestic economy, but India’s goods would have to be globally competitive. Here, the experience of South Korea is relevant. As most of the produced inputs into production are available to all countries via trade, a country’s competitiveness is ultimately determined by the productivity of its workforce and the physical infrastructure that complements labour. The strength and dexterity of a workforce, manifested as productivity, is related to its health and skill. In both these categories, India’s workers are at a disadvantage compared to the most successful economies of Asia. To have not brought its workers on a par with the rest has prevented India from using the world market to grow. It can do so now

A second route to greater output and employment is to expand the domestic market — and thus aggregate demand. To see how this can be done, recognise that the economy produces both food and non-agricultural goods and services. These are placed differently in relation to our consumption needs. If food can be produced at lower cost, the real income of the majority of Indian households would rise. They would now have more to spend on non-agricultural goods and services having satisfied their need for food. This would generate the demand needed to spur production in the rest of the economy. And with this, output will also grow, and in turn employment, with or without the longer hours in question.

In conclusion, it cannot be emphasised enough that Mr. Narayana Murthy’s proposal that Indians work for 70 hours a week is surely meant for those in the formal sector, where specified work hours and a minimum wage stipulation exist. Ethnographic studies of India’s informal sector show that in some of its segments, unorganised workers are already labouring this long at very low wages and without any such protection. Here, the challenge is to activate the long arm of the law to ensure acceptable working conditions that encompass fewer hours, higher wages, and more equipment to lessen the physical burden of labouring.

The national selectors on Monday entrusted a set of next-gen stars under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav with the task of taming Australia in the upcoming five-match T20I series, beginning from November 23 at Visakhapatnam.

After a draining campaign in the recent ODI World Cup, India expectedly did not pick many senior players in the 15-member squad, with only Suryakumar, pacer Prasidh Krishna and wicketkeeper batter Ishan Kishan crossing over for the T20Is.

The selectors felt that these three players have not played enough cricket to warrant workload management at this moment.

Middle-order battter Shreyas Iyer will join the team for the last two matches at Raipur and Bengaluru and he will take over the vice-captain’s role from Ruturaj Gaikwad.

Axar Patel has also found a place in the squad after he missed the quadrennial big bash with a left quadriceps injury.

However, the left-arm spinner returned to competitive cricket last month for Gujarat in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he played two matches against Punjab and Railways.

When it comes to the younger names in the squad, those players already have considerable exposure to the top-level cricket as they were part of the Indian squad for the three-match T20I series against Ireland and then for the Asian Games in Hangzhou.

The mandarins pegged the selection of players mainly on them having two good successive IPL seasons and the members in the squad have that against their names.

However, some of the performers in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy such as batters Riyan Parag, Abhishek Sharma and veteran pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar could not find a berth in the squad.

Bhuvneshwar has picked up 16 wickets from seven matches in the SMAT at an impressive economy of 5.84 but the selectors felt that his pace has dropped considerably, barely averaging 130 kmph.

Parag and Sharma were in contention after their excellent run in the SMAT. Parag, who plays for Assam, was the leading run-scorer in the tournament with 510 runs from 10 matches, including seven fifties with a strike rate of 182.

Punjab left-hander Sharma, who is also a useful left-arm spinner, was the second highest run-getter in the SMAT with 485 runs from 10 matches, including two hundreds and three fifties with a strike-rate of 192.

But the powers that be felt that while these two players held out promise, they needed to show more consistency in the IPL to merit a place in the national side.

Sanju Samson might have been hoping to find a place in the squad but the Kerala batsmen was a notable absentee.

Perhaps, his lukewarm effort in the SMAT forced the selectors to overlook him for the time being.

Samson made a modest 138 runs from eight matches at an average of 27 and his strike-rate hovered around 145. He had made two fifties in the event.

However, Samson will get a chance to impress the selectors in the upcoming Vijay Hazare one-day tournament while leading Kerala.

Former India batter VVS Laxman will be the head coach of the team for the series.

India squad: Suryakumar Yadav (Captain), Ruturaj Gaikwad (vice-captain), Ishan Kishan, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Shivam Dubey, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar."

For both Australia and India, China is the biggest trading partner, and China is our “biggest security anxiety”, said Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles, making the opening remarks at the 2+2 dialogue on Monday. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said this is a partnership which is “consequential for us, but it is crucial for our region.”

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said there is consensus on both sides that a strong India-Australia partnership will augur well, “not just for the usual benefit of both our countries but also for the overall peace, security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.” Defence in particular has become one of the “most important pillars” of the strategic partnership, Mr. Singh noted, to which Mr. Marles concurred, and said it is very much part of the “bedrock” of the bilateral relationship.

Noting that the bilateral relationship has certainly grown rapidly, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said it also has larger implications for the region and a “lot of other countries look to us and to our relationship in many ways as a factor of stability and security.” This, he said, happened at a time when there is increasing uncertainty in the world. “We are seeing sharper polarisation, deeper stresses and today it is important to ensure that the routine is there for the region to feel safer...”

“This is a partnership which is consequential for us, but it is crucial for our region. And we see you, India, as central, crucial to the sort of region we continue to work for — peaceful, stable, prosperous and where sovereignty is respected and we look forward in this discussion to going further on the ways in which we can both work together...,” Ms. Wong said.

Mr. Marles who reached India on Sunday and watched the cricket world cup final in Ahmedabad, said in a contemporary sense, the “home of cricket now really is in India.” Describing himself as a cricket enthusiast, he stated, “I think for those of us who like cricket, the pilgrimage that we all want to make now is to this country and it was just a fulfillment of a long term dream for me to be able to actually watch cricket being played here in India.”

Strategic alignment

And the shared love of this sport by both the countries embodies the state of the bilateral relationship, Mr. Marles said. “We are two countries which share history, we share democratic traditions, we share rule of law, freedom of speech... Well our strategic alignment is greater than it has ever been.” He also held bilateral talks with Mr. Singh and Mr. Jaishankar earlier in the day. “We share an ocean, and in that sense, we are neighbours,” Mr. Marles added.

The relationship has seen a transformation in recent years, which was noted by the Ministers. Talking of the milestones, Mr. Jaishankar referred to the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) which entered into force last December, and said they are seeing its economic implications unfold this year in terms of trade increase.

On Tuesday, Mr. Jaishankar and Ms. Wong will hold the 14th Foreign Ministerial Framework Dialogue (FMFD) where the progress on the ongoing negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) will also be reviewed.

Mr. Jaishankar also said that they are facing “exceptional challenges”, some regional, some global, many of them involve “challenges to the rule of law” and as comprehensive strategic partners it is important to also “plan” for those exceptions, which could be man-made exceptions, or humanitarian assistance and disaster relief situations. It’s important that we have a “culture of cooperation” in order to respond, he stressed.

“Four, partnership in the Quad format has been very beneficial for the Indo-Pacific region and indeed for our own bilateral relationship,” Mr. Jaishankar added.

On the tempo of engagements, Mr. Jaishankar said the two Prime Ministers have met five times this year, trice in each other’s countries and in other occasions as well. In this regard, Ms. Wong said that since they were elected there were some 19 ministerial visits to India by their government."

NSRCEL, the incubation arm of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB) organized “Circular Conversations: Where Innovation and Impact Collide,” an interaction that brought together innovators, start-ups and other stakeholders with a focus on circular economy.

The event was held on 17November with an aim to showcase the collective efforts by various industry players to drive innovation and create an impact within the domain of circular economy.

More than 45 ecosystem stakeholders including start-ups, thought leaders, incubators, impact funds, academia, and CSR donors participated in the event that provided a platform to discuss, exchange ideas and foster collaborations that focus on sustainability.

Among the organisations that participated were the World Research Institute, ALSTOM, Rainmatter Foundation, Villgro, Caspian Impact Investments, Avaana Capital, Saahas, Hasiru Dala Innovations, Capgemini and more.

Young start-ups and enterprises spoke about several challenges that are common across the industry and hindered the growth of start-ups within the domain. These included challenges related to raising funds, policy regulations, customer demand and mindset, and circularity in supply chain – especially in packaging solutions.

Given that sustainable products often come with a premium charge, they noted that it was often a challenge in a market like India where price point is one of the biggest priorities for the customer.

“How do you show value to the customer – that I’m charging a premium because my product is sustainable? Does the average Indian customer care about sustainable products?” wondered Mayank B. Nagori, cofounder at Good Gum, an FMCG start-up making plastic-free chewing gums.

Seetharaman Basavanahalli, co-founder at Indic Initiatives which work towards recycling and upcycling solutions, spoke of the several policy level challenges faced by sustainable start-ups in the country. Experts wondered if sustainable consumption is not a priority for the customer, could the push for it come through policy incentives for companies working towards creating a circular economy.

Innovative solutions

The participants were later divided into groups to explore innovative solutions to address the four major challenges that came up during the discussion and maximise impact.

Strategies were discussed to find the right set of customers, create platforms to promote sustainable products and change people’s aspirations towards sustainable choices.

When it came to circularity within the supply chain, standardization of materials such as those used for labelling and packaging were one of the solutions put forward.

“It would also make the life of those working in the recycling industry much easier,” noted Divya Tiwari, Principal Scientist and Advisor at Saahas.

It was pointed out that while there is a lot of capital in the global market looking to invest in sustainability start-ups, many of them lacked the confidence to invest in Indian companies due to red tapism and lack of a clean image.

Experts also spoke of the several myths around sustainability – such as paper cups are better than multiuse plastic cups - that currently exists among consumers.

This was the first of many conversations facilitated by NSRCEL in the circular economy space and the organization intends to bring together many more stakeholders going forward.

Dynamic domain

Commenting on the event, Anand Sri Ganesh, CEO of NSRCEL, said, “In the dynamic domains of circularity, sustainability, and climate-tech, NSRCEL leads the way, tackling critical start-up challenges. Our innovative platform empowers founders to explore and influence India’s Circular Economy.”

“Today, at Circular Conversations, we unite visionaries, innovators, and stakeholders to collaboratively shape the future of the circular economy. Anticipating ongoing success, we commit to hosting future events of this nature,” he added."

Rohit Sharma was Monday named the captain of the ICC's Team of the Tournament after the conclusion of the World Cup, with a total of six Indians including the Player of the Tournament, Virat Kohli, featuring among the XI.

India lost the summit clash to Australia who clinched their sixth World Cup title with a six-wicket victory in Ahmedabad on Sunday.

Rohit led the team from the front as his fearless batting won him praise from all corners, with the Indian skipper finishing as the second highest scorer in the tournament with 597 runs in 11 matches at 54.27 with one century and three fifties.

Kohli, who became the first batter ever to score more than 700 runs in a single World Cup edition, finished with a total of 765 runs with three centuries and two fifties.

In the course of the tournament, Kohli also surpassed batting legend Sachin Tendulkar to have scored most ODI centuries when he recorded his 50th ton in the semifinal.

With more than half of the ICC's Team of the Tournament comprising Indian players, it was yet another indication of the fact that despite not winning the title, the hosts were the best side in the competition having registered a record 10 wins on the trot.

Wicketkeeper-batter and vice-captain K.L. Rahul, who made 452 runs at 75.33 with one century and two fifties, finished as the eighth-highest run-scorer in the World Cup and was named in the Team of the Tournament.

Despite missing four matches of the league stage initially, Mohammed Shami finished as the best bowler with 24 wickets in only seven matches at 12.20.

""Only four players in the history of the men's game have taken more Cricket World Cup wickets than Shami's 55 — Lasith Malinga (56) Mitchell Starc (65), Muttiah Muralitharan (68) and Glenn McGrath (71) — with Shami's returns coming in ten fewer matches than any of those above him in the list,"" the ICC said on its website.

India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who was the fourth most successful bowler in the World Cup with 20 wickets in 11 matches at 18.65, also features in the ICC XI.

""No bowler to have played more than a single game in the tournament was able to return a better economy rate than Bumrah's 4.06 — an even more remarkable stat considering he was so often in action when the fielding restrictions were in place,"" the ICC said.

Ravindra Jadeja featured in the team alongside Australia veteran Glenn Maxwell for his all-round exploits in the competition.

""India's spin-bowling all-rounder played a crucial role for his team, taking key wickets throughout the middle overs and consistently turning the screw,"" the ICC said.

South Africa's wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock, who is now retired from the ODI format given the World Cup is over, was named as one of the two openers in the competition having scored four centuries for the Proteas during their excellent run in the league stage.

The coveted No 4 slot went to New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell, who was the only batter to have dominated the Indian bowlers when they were on song during their two meetings — one at the league stage and the other at the semifinals.

With 552 runs in 10 matches, Mitchell finished as the fifth highest run-getter with two tons and as many fifties.

Sri Lanka's young Dilshan Madushanka's was a standout performance in an otherwise forgettable World Cup campaign. His 21 wickets in nine matches saw him finish as the third highest wicket-taker.

Winners Australia's sole specialist spinner Adam Zampa, who finished as the second-best bowler with 23 wickets in 11 matches, featured at the last spot while South Africa's Gerald Coetzee was named the 12th man.

The speakers at a conference on “Ports and Multimodal Transportation – Aiming towards First and Last Mile Connectivity”, said that improving road and rail infrastructure, and thereby reducing logistics cost, is essential to tap the tremendous potential of Visakhapatnam city, which in turn can boost the economy of Andhra Pradesh.

The Visakhapatnam Port Authority (VPA) and the Adani Gangavaram Port, both located in the city, were together handling around 100 MT s of cargo, and their total capacity was expected to double in future, they said at the conference, organised by CII Andhra Pradesh, here on Tuesday.

S.V.K. Reddy, CEO of AP Inland Waterways Authority, Government of AP, said that the high cost of logistics was adding up to the total production cost by about 30%. A major share of this was going towards high transportation and handling cost. Water transport could bring down the cost by about 50% and it was also eco-friendly. He underlined the need for integration of coastal transport with inland waterways.

B.G. Gandhi, CEO of Adani Gangavaram Port Limited, underlined the need to develop the road infrastructure in the city and to the hinterland. Visakhapatnam has the added advantage of having two ports and major industries like Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP).

M. Muralidhar, COO, Kakinada Seaports Ltd., said that the PM GatiShakti Master Plan, introduced by the Centre, has raised the hopes of the industry. He felt that it was for the State government to take advantage of the scheme to improve infrastructure to meet the future challenges. National Highways should be at least eight to 10 lanes, and the State was lagging behind in this regard. He also called for improvement of the rail network.

KV Mahidhar, Executive Director and Head, CII – Institute of Logistics, in his talk on “Building East Coast Logistics Capital – Visakhapatnam” said that Andhra Pradesh has three industrial corridors, and if any of them came into play, the growth would be exponential. The infrastructure development should be planned to meet that growth. Visakhapatnam was among the top 10 cities in India in GDP, and urban population was growing.

G. Sambasiva Rao, convener, Infrastructure & Logistics Panel, CII AP, said that lack of improvement of road infrastructure during the last 25 years, and the tremendous increase in road traffic were resulting in high incidence of road accidents. He said that exclusive lanes were required for heavy vehicles, carrying goods from the hinterland to the ports and vice versa.

The Congress on November 20 said senior Union Ministers from poll-bound States like Rajasthan and Telangana shared “bogus and fake news” that India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has crossed the four-trillion dollar mark only to generate euphoria and headline management.

“Between 2:45 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. yesterday, when the nation was glued to watching the cricket match, various drumbeaters of the Modi government, including senior Union Ministers from Rajasthan and Telangana, the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, as well as the Prime Minister’s most favoured businessman, tweeted that yesterday itself India’s GDP had crossed the $4 trillion mark,” Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said.

“This was totally fake and bogus news meant to generate more euphoria and a pathetic attempt at both sycophancy and headline management,” he alleged.

An unverified screenshot from the live-tracking GDP feed for all countries, based on the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) data, was shared by several BJP leaders including Union Ministers.

Though there has been no official comment from the Ministry of Finance or the government, sources claimed the news is incorrect as India’s GDP is yet to achieve the $4 trillion landmark. They pointed out that live tracking of the GDP figures of all countries is difficult since data from different sectors of the economy have a time lag."
62,The Hindu,Steering road safety in India back onto the right lane - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/steering-road-safety-in-india-back-onto-the-right-lane/article67551641.ece,,"November 20, 2023 01:23 am | Updated 01:23 am IST

India’s roads are a paradox. They represent an enormous and growing opportunity to commute and connect, to transport and travel. They go hand in hand with the country’s modernisation and impressive economic progress. In this context, India has some of the greatest opportunities to build a strong road safety management framework, with strong helmet producers, car manufacturers, big tech and large road investments. And yet, as in many countries, they are also the source of a silent but deadly pandemic.

Each year, a staggering 3,00,000 people are estimated to be killed on the road in India, according to the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO). That is equivalent to more than 34 people every hour of every day. And that is a conservative estimate. The number of people suffering life-altering injuries in road crashes is exponentially higher even than that. Beyond human suffering, there is a serious economic toll: In India, road crashes are estimated to cost between 5% and 7% of national GDP.

India, and the wider region in which it sits, is far from alone. Road safety is a global problem, with 1.3 million people killed in road crashes every year. But almost one in every four road deaths around the world takes place in India.

World Day of Remembrance

As the planet commemorated the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on November 19 to provide a platform for road traffic victims and their families to remember, support and act, such figures should serve as a wake-up call to all of us. We need immediate, coordinated and evidence-based interventions to boost road safety and drastically reduce the daily human tragedies behind the alarming statistics.

This will require strategic investments in road safety measures, concerted political will at the national, State and local levels, and a change of collective mindset — after all, every one of us is a road user in some way — to understand and tackle the scale and importance of the challenge. Last week, the Government released a report that 2022 was the most fatal year for traffic crashes in India.

Focus areas for better safety

Priority areas must include enforcing the use of seatbelts not just for drivers but also for their passengers. Wearing a seatbelt reduces the risk of death among drivers and front-seat occupants by 45% to 50%, and the risk of death and serious injuries among rear-seat occupants by 25%. Similarly, helmet use must be enforced among motorcyclists as well as their pillion passengers. Correct helmet use can lead to a 42% reduction in the risk of fatal injuries.

Indeed, vulnerable road users, who include pedestrians, cyclists and the riders of two-wheelers, account for almost three quarters of road deaths in India. And passengers unbelted in the back seat are not only risks to themselves upon impact but also to those in the front seat.

Speeding must be reduced and there can be no tolerance for drink-driving; a recent report by the Government revealed that speeding led to 70% of India’s road crash deaths. Road infrastructure should be enhanced — too many roads are not in a safe condition, although government programmes in recent years have led to rapid improvements — and large-scale public awareness campaigns such as the new UN global campaign for road safety #MakeASafetyStatement, involving international celebrities, must be undertaken to secure behavioural changes.

The call to action is not new. The Sustainable Development Goals, created in 2015, include a target (3.6) to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road crashes and a call (11.2) to make public transport safer, more affordable and more accessible to all.

The good news is that we are already seeing steps in the right direction in India. The national government’s implementation of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, and enhanced data collection from road crashes, are impactful measures that will help experts better understand where and why crashes are occurring, and, therefore, how to reduce them.

The UN helmet

Police in the major cities, such as the capital, New Delhi, are adopting modern technologies such as intelligent traffic management systems to effectively regulate traffic flows in a much better way and minimise the potential for collision. To help increase access to safe helmets, the Special Envoy has worked with helmet producers to produce a low-cost ventilated United Nations standard helmet, for under $20, including here in India.

Private sector companies are searching for solutions. This is only right: we cannot expect to succeed if we do not have a whole-of-society effort to improve road safety. But we are still only at the start of the journey. Your chances of surviving a road crash can vary enormously depending on what State you live in and what access you have to high-quality emergency care services and proper after-care.

We also need to look increasingly at international best practices and successes and then adapt them to India’s specific needs and circumstances.

Road safety is a complex and multi-dimensional challenge, but the benefits that come with addressing it can be equally profound. What we need is a comprehensive safe-system approach as envisaged in the UN’s the Second Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030, and full implementation of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019.

Ending the silent pandemic of road injuries will not only save lives but also strengthen the economy and improve the quality of life for everyone.

More and more Indian entrepreneurs from Europe and the United States are heading back to India where the economy is growing and opportunities are large, Saurabh Srivastava, the former NASSCOM chairman, has said.

“Today, more and more Indian entrepreneurs are heading back to India from Europe and the U.S. have achieved success in those markets,” Mr. Srivastava, the co-founder of the National Association of Software and Services Company (NASSCOM), said on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Festival from November 15-17 here.

“This is because the economy is growing and the opportunities are large and the government is very focused on entrepreneurs.” Mr. Srivastava said he wants to see the Indian economy growing at double-digit though it is stable at the current 6.5% growth.

Given the large 1.4 billion population, India should have a million startups to drive the economic growth, said the Padma Shree Awardee, who has funded about 150 startups.

“Indians are among the most inspirational people in the world, and we should not have difficulties in growing at a faster pace,” he said.

Mr. Srivastava pointed out that the GIFT City in Ahmedabad is an excellent initiative in winning investments and the business community by creating a tax-free zone.

Solar and wind energy are now available while the Indian space sector is set to be a global leader, he said.

Mr. Srivastava, who wears a number of hats in Indian institutions and the corporate sector, had also played a lead role in the setting up The Indus Enterprise (TIE) chapter in Singapore in 2001.

He recalled how the Singapore government had welcomed and supported the idea of TIE Singapore chapter, and called for its members to be multi-nationals in line with the prosperous city state’s large MNC community."

Cash assistance, subsidised LPG cylinders, free education from kindergarten to postgraduation, and free rides on urban public transport — it is election season in five States and political parties are bending over backwards to woo women voters with a slew of promises. Coupled with the historic passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Special Session of Parliament in September, it would seem that women have arrived electorally in the country.

That is not the whole story, however, as a closer look at poll statistics reveals. While most political parties recognise the emergence of women as a voting bloc who can swing elections, offering them polls sops, a similar commitment seems to be lacking when it comes to giving tickets to women candidates.

Growing turnout

Analysts feel that the reason for increasing poll promises for women is the increasing voter turnout of women over the years.

The current set of poll-bound States provide an example of this phenomenon. In Rajasthan, the voting percentage of women has grown from 41% in 1962 to 74% in 2018; in Madhya Pradesh, it has grown even more sharply, from 29% to 78%. While in united Andhra Pradesh, 59% of women came out to vote in 1962, in Telangana in 2018, the figure was 73%. In Chattisgarh, where the first Assembly elections were held in 2003, the women’s voting percentage has increased from 67% in that first poll to 76% in 2018.

“It is after the 2009 elections that the women voters have become significant. The voter turnout of women has matched that of men,” says Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder of Political Shakti, an NGO working on gender equality in politics.

Swing voters

While in some States, the gap has closed, in many other States the voting percentage of women has actually exceeded that of men; political parties now realise that by wooing women voters, they can actually swing the vote.

According to Ms. Krishnaswamy, the first politicians to cash in and benefit from this were West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Professor Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Developing Societies agrees. “They are perfect examples. In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party did get a proportionately higher vote from women, as also is the case with the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar.”

On the question of whether women can actually swing the vote, he says that unlike Dalits, women are yet to emerge as a distinct voting bloc for any particular party. What has started is a tilt towards particular parties by women voters, which can swing 2% to 3% votes in their favour, critical in a tight election.

Few tickets for women

The expected swing vote and the resultant poll sops being offered to women, however, does not translate into tickets for women candidates by most parties. In the current Assembly polls for example, most political parties have given merely 10% to 15% of tickets to women candidates.

Take a look at the two major national parties. In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has fielded only 30 women in the 230 Assembly constituencies, while the BJP has fielded 27. In Chhattisgarh, the Congress has given 18 out of 90 seats to women, while the BJP offered tickets to 15 women. The numbers for Rajasthan are 27 women out of total 199 seats for Congress, and 19 out of 200 for the BJP. In Telangana, out of 119 Assembly seats, the Congress has chosen 12 women candidates, the BJP has fielded 15 women, and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi has just eight women candidates.

Low winnability

This is a far cry from the position of near gender equality when it comes to equal participation in voting, as well as from the 33% reservation promised for women by the Union government in its new law.

The low number of tickets for women candidates seems to stem from a strong belief that their winnability is also low, especially if the opposing party puts up a male candidate for the same seat.

Data also shows that, so far, women themselves are not hugely inclined to vote for another woman. Thus, higher voter participation is not a reason to give more tickets to women.

Impact of male migration

Political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay says that there is a need to look at the increasing women voters’ participation through the prism of economic conditions rather than the empowerment debate. “It is true that in a large number of constituencies, you have more women voters than men. This is a symptom of the terrible state of the Indian economy. Men continue to be primary breadwinners. They work in bigger cities and the family stays back home. This has particularly increased in the last five years,” he says.

“Post-COVID, there are a large number of women who returned home, but have not gone back to work to the cities,” he adds. Thus, it is not so much that there is a dramatic rise in the number of women voters, but rather the lack of men who can vote in their homes."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday “strongly condemned” the civilian casualties in the ongoing violence in Gaza Strip. Delivering the inaugural speech at the second virtual Voice of Global South Summit, Mr. Modi reiterated his condemnation of the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, and said that the Global South should speak in one voice on critical matters. He further announced that India is set to host a global partnership summit on artificial intelligence (AI) next month which will promote responsible use of technology to reduce the gap between developed and developing economies.

“We are all seeing that developments in West Asia are giving birth to new challenges. India has condemned the dastardly terror attack on Israel on October 7. We urged for restrained response along with dialogue and diplomacy. We strongly condemn the death of civilians in Israel-Hamas conflict,” said Prime Minister Modi in his remarks.

Briefing the media later in the evening, Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra informed that several participating leaders raised the ongoing violence in Gaza as well as concern about international terrorism.

The first Voice of Global South Summit, last January, was dominated by the commodities crisis triggered by the Ukraine war. However, the eruption of the crisis in the Gaza Strip has shifted focus considerably from Ukraine to West Asia. As in the case of Ukraine, India has initiated the operation to evacuate nationals from Israel even as PM Modi and External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar continue to hold conversations with regional stakeholders in West Asia and the Gulf region, which is home to around six million expatriate workers. “After speaking to President Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine, India sent relief material to the Palestinians,” PM Modi said highlighting India’s commitment to find a solution to the crisis that has killed around 11,000 Palestinian civilians including at least five thousand children.

Friday’s summit also witnessed the launch of DAKSHIN – the Development and Knowledge Sharing Initiative – Global South Centre for Excellence. This initiative was announced during the first virtual summit in January and was realised on Friday. ”The Global South Centre for Excellence will work as a think tank and also as a repository of knowledge for development initiatives,” Foreign Secretary Kwatra said while explaining the scope of the centre. He also informed that a new initiative Global South Young Diplomats Forum was launched during the deliberations of Friday.

Highlighting the attention that India has extended to the Global South during its Presidency of G-20, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar said it was necessary to extend attention of G-20 to the “pressing needs” of the Global South that were disturbed by the pandemic and conflicts. “All of us are acutely aware of the growing stress on the international economy and global society. Longstanding structural inequities have been seriously aggravated by the devastation of the Covid pandemic. This has been made still worse by the fuel, food and fertiliser crises emanating from the Ukraine conflict and its responses.

PM Modi revisited the diplomatic outreach by India to the Global South that was witnessed during the G-20 summit of last September. He specifically highlighted the inclusion of the African Union as a new member in the G-20 grouping. He further urged that the gap between the North and the South should be minimised to ensure access to new technology and initiatives.

“New technology should not become a source of creating distance between the North and the South. In this age of AI, it is necessary to ensure responsible use of technology. To ensure that next month India will host AI technology summit,” PM Modi said."

India is undertaking the world’s largest planned urbanisation programme and the total investment in urban development has risen ten times over the last decade, Union Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on November 16.

Mr. Puri said that the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has also undertaken various measures to address climate change through its ongoing missions, including the Smart Cities Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission, AMRUT and Urban Transport, among others.

He was speaking at the launch of the second phase of the City Investments To Innovate, Integrate and Sustain (CITIIS) programme which envisages fostering climate-sensitive planning in Indian cities and driving investments into urban climate action through specific projects.

The CITIIS 2.0, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet on May 31, has been conceived by the Urban Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the French Development Agency (AFD), KfW Development Bank, the European Union and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).

The programme aims to drive investments into urban climate action through competitively selected projects promoting a circular economy with a focus on integrated waste management.

It also seeks to foster climate-sensitive planning and action in States and cities through evidence-driven approaches and build institutional mechanisms, leverage partnerships and anchor capacity building for all urban local bodies in India.

“CITIIS 2.0 will complement the Smart Cities Mission and converge with the Swachh Bharat Mission to enable innovation throughout the value chain of waste management in our cities”, Mr. Puri said.

The total funding for CITIIS 2.0 includes a loan of ₹1,760 crores, or €200 million, from AFD and KfW (€100 million each). The programme will also receive a technical assistance grant of ₹106 crores ( €12 million) from the European Union.

All 100 Smart Cities are eligible to seek assistance under CITIIS 2.0 programme.

Up to 18 innovative projects promoting the circular economy with a focus on integrated waste management shall be selected for assistance. The CITIIS grant amount for each project will be limited to 80% of the total project cost, up to ₹135 crore (90% of the total project cost, in the case of North-Eastern and Hill States). The additional funds, that is 20% of the total project cost (10 % in the case of NE and hill States) will be mobilised by the selected city on its own."

KLE Academy of Higher Education and Research (KAHER) will set up an Incubation and Innovation Centre in Belagavi for healthcare technology research and development.

“This initiative is poised to make a substantial impact not only on the educational and research landscape, but also on the Indian economy,” KLE Society chairman and KAHER chancellor Prabhakar Kore told journalists in Belagavi on November 17.

“KAHER Incubation and Innovation centre (KIIC) recognizes the critical role that innovation plays in advancing healthcare and medical technology. KIIC is designed to be a catalyst for entrepreneurship, research and innovation by providing a nurturing environment and platform for startups and innovators to develop path breaking technologies. KIIC is expected to generate employment opportunities by supporting the growth of healthcare startups. As these ventures expand, they will contribute to job creation, helping alleviate unemployment in the region and beyond,” he said.

“By fostering a culture of innovation, KIIC aims to contribute significantly to the growth of the healthcare and medical technology sectors in line with India aspirations to be a global supply chain hub in addition to catering to the captive demand within the country. Successful startups have the potential to attract investment, thus positively impacting the overall economic landscape.

“KIIC shall facilitate transfer of cutting edge technologies from the academic sphere to enable commercialisation by startups. This technology transfer and innovation shall lead to creation of marketable and cost-effective products and services, thereby reducing import dependency and fostering entrepreneurship within the country,” he said.

“Industry partnerships formed by KIIC shall enhance collaboration between academia and the private sector. This synergy is expected to result in the development of innovative solutions that address real-world healthcare challenges, thereby boosting economic competitiveness. KIIC is in active discussions to partner with leading incubators, such as IIT-Kanpur (SIIC), which shall result in knowledge sharing, commercialization of existing patents & technologies and cross-pollination between startups & academia at both eco-systems.

“The inauguration of the Centre, likely to be held in January 2024, will be a momentous occasion featuring dignitaries from the government, academia, and industry. It will highlight the centre’s potential to drive economic growth through innovation in healthcare and medical technology sector,” Dr. Kore said."

The value of foreign portfolio investors' holdings in domestic equities reached $651 billion in the three months ended September 2023, which was 15% higher than the year-ago period, according to a Morningstar report.

This could be attributed to the good performance of the domestic equity markets as well as strong net FPI inflows.

According to the report, the value of FPIs' investments in Indian equities rose from $566 billion as of September 2022 to $651 billion at the end of September 2023.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the value of such investment rose 4% from $626 billion recorded in the three months ended June this year.

Despite the growth, FPIs' contribution to Indian equity market capitalisation fell marginally during the quarter under review to 16.95% from 17.33% in the previous quarter.

Picking up from the June quarter, foreign investors continued their buying spree in the Indian equity markets for the most part of the September quarter with a net infusion of $5.38 billion.

Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pumped $5.68 billion into Indian equities in July on steady earnings growth recovery, stable macro fundamentals, and the challenges faced by the Chinese economy and concerns over its recovery. Additionally, the resilient state of the domestic economy and the markets amid global uncertainty also attracted foreign investors toward Indian equities.

However, the pace of investments from FPIs ebbed substantially in August to $1.48 billion on concerns on the global macro front on the back of higher crude oil prices and the resurfacing of inflation risks.

""The firming up of bond yields in the US also led some foreign investors to drift away from riskier markets in favour of the greater certainty and better risk/reward profile of US Treasuries. Also, the intermittent rally in the Indian equity markets resulted in its valuation going beyond the comfort level of investors,"" the report noted.

This scenario led foreign investors to become net sellers in the Indian equity markets in September, the first time in six months. Through the month, they sold net assets to the tune of $1.78 billion.

""This was primarily because of continued economic uncertainties in the US and eurozone regions, as well as growing concerns about global economic growth. This led foreign investors to turn risk-averse. A sharp surge in the US Treasury bond yields also didn't augur well for emerging-markets equities, resulting in a sell-off from foreign investors,"" the report said.

Additionally, higher crude prices, sticky inflation numbers, and the expectation that interest rates may continue to remain at elevated levels for longer than expected prompted foreign investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach. Subnormal monsoon activity in India and its impact on inflation was also a concern for the domestic economy, it added.

Since then, FPIs have been on a selling spree. While in October they were net sellers to the tune of $2.95 billion, in November so far (till November 10), they have sold net assets worth $697 million."

India’s economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1% annually in fiscal years 2024-2026, S&P Global Ratings said on November 16.

In a report titled ‘Global Banks Country-By-Country Outlook 2024’, S&P said the banking sector’s weak loans will decline to 3-3.5% of gross advances by March 31, 2025, on the back of structural improvement, including healthy corporate balance sheets, tighter underwriting standards and improved risk-management practices.

Interest rates in India are unlikely to rise materially, and this should limit the risk for the banking industry, it added.

“Unsecured personal loans have grown rapidly and could contribute to incremental NPLs. We believe underwriting standards for retail loans generally remain healthy and overall level of delinquencies remains within acceptable limits for this product category,” S&P Primary Credit Analyst Deepali Seth Chhabria said.

The report said that global uncertainties will have a lesser impact on the Indian economy.

Slower global growth and external demand will weigh on economic activity and could fuel further inflation. However, given that India is domestically oriented, the agency expects the economic growth to be less affected, it added.

“Economic growth momentum to continue. India’s economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1% annually in fiscal years 2024-2026,” S&P said.

India’s real GDP rose 7.8% year-on-year in the June quarter, up from 6.1% in the March quarter.

The Reserve Bank of India has forecast a 6.5% economic growth for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscal years.

The report further said that the State Bank of India and the leading private-sector banks have largely addressed their asset-quality challenges.

Many public-sector banks still carry relatively high volumes of weak assets, which will result in higher credit losses and hit profitability; their performance lags that of the industry."
71,The Hindu,Should elections be state funded? - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/should-elections-be-state-funded/article67540233.ece,,"A Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, D.Y. Chandrachud, recently reserved its judgment on petitions challenging the validity of the electoral bonds scheme. The proceedings focused on arguments pertaining to the voters’ right to information vis-a-vis the right to confidentiality of donors. Transparency in election funding has become the central issue here. Should elections be state funded instead? Jagdeep Chhokar and Sanjay Kumar discuss the question in a conversation moderated by Sreeparna Chakrabarty. Edited excerpts:

Can state funding of elections bring in transparency in the poll process?

Jagdeep Chhokar: First, calling it state funding of elections is a misnomer. It should be called public funding of elections. I say this because in India, we unfortunately have a notion that whatever the state does is free. If there is such funding, it will be public money that the state will be giving for elections. So, if we call it public funding of elections, my sense is that people will feel that it is their money, which is the truth.

Public funding of elections can certainly bring transparency in the poll process, but it depends on how it is done. If public money is given to political parties and candidates, and let’s say they are also welcome to get money from wherever they like, then there are serious issues. Public funding in principle is a good idea, but the mechanics of it need to be fleshed out.

Sanjay Kumar: I think it would be a welcome step, but I’m not sure whether it will bring about transparency in the electoral process because we need to look at the nitty-gritty of how this is going to be worked out, we need to look at what state funding means.

It would certainly be better than the existing system where candidates and political parties spend from their own pocket and a lot of black money goes into election campaigning. State funding of elections will help bring some transparency. But I’m not sure whether the entire electoral process will become transparent with state funding of elections alone.

Four reports have looked into the viability of state funding of elections. The Indrajit Gupta Committee Report, the Law Commission of India Report of 1999, the Report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission in 2008, and the National Commission to review the working of the Constitution Report of 2001. The first three said that state funding is desirable to an extent. Is it viable for the Indian economy?

Jagdeep Chhokar: We can discuss viability provided we agree that public funding is desirable, which I think it is. You mentioned four reports. If you read the Indrajit Gupta Committee Report, which is most often quoted in support of public funding of elections, it says state funding should be done only in kind and not in cash. It also says that state funding of elections would be a waste of public resources unless it is accompanied by factors such as democratisation of political parties and decriminalisation of the political process. It says unless there is internal democracy in political parties, state funding of elections will be a waste of public money. So, it lays down conditions under which public funding of elections can be, and should be, considered, and not necessarily adopted. State funding is viable only if parties are internally and demonstrably democratic in their functioning, transparent in their financial affairs, and there is a reliable mechanism of ensuring that parties and candidates do not accept money from other sources.

Now, if there is public funding of elections, how much provision should we make for that? If an amount is to be set aside for public funding of elections, we need to know how much money was spent in the last election. That number depends on a couple of factors. First, the money that the Election Commission of India spent. This data is available and reasonably accurate. Second, the amount spent by political parties and candidates. This figure is known only to political parties and candidates who contest elections.

Professor Kumar, the Indrajit Gupta Committee had said that whatever funding is given should be in kind, such as free transport. How would this work? And is it possible to explore a system which is partially public funded?

Sanjay Kumar: People need to discuss this because the question is about a possibility. Is this possible or not? I think it is possible. You have to work out a model. We cannot say this is not possible at all or that this is perfectly alright. Political parties need to be part of the decision-making process.

A few years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a discussion on public funding of elections. Before that, the Congress had also raised it. But nothing has come out of these statements. Why have parties never taken this issue forward?

Sanjay Kumar: Political parties support it because state funding of elections is seen as socially desirable or desirable in the electoral context. But they have not been able to move ahead with this because at the moment, this is just a concept. Nobody is clear about how it is to be worked out.

Also, is it a case that except the two large national parties, most political parties, especially regional parties, have now become family-oriented?

Sanjay Kumar: How does that relate to state funding of elections? Suppose the government decides to give ₹100 crore to political parties for poll contests. How will this amount be distributed? The benchmark should be the party’s performance in the last Lok Sabha or Assembly elections, not whether the party is being headed by a family member or not.

Jagdeep Chhokar: I am amused that Professor Kumar is saying or at least implying that the party which gets more votes should get more money. That if Party A won or got more votes in the last election, it should get more money for this election. If that party then has more money than the parties that have lost, it will be an uneven playing field.

Sanjay Kumar: I was only stating a limited point that if the funding is to be supported by the government, the criteria cannot be whether a party is being headed by a family or a party which has a democratically elected leader. There have to be different criteria, and I was just citing an example. I’m not saying that the party which has performed better should get more money or a party which has performed poorly should get less. Things can be worked out. This could be one possibility. But my intervention was to another point: if a party has a leader who is democratically elected, we can’t say there should be different criteria for giving funds to that party while parties which are family parties should be punished with less funds.

Jagdeep Chhokar: It is problematic to say that the money to be given to political parties depends on their electoral performance. No party today functions as a political party. Political parties function as corporates. Their business is to win elections and make money to be able to win the next elections. So, this functioning of political parties as corporate entities or as family-run corporate entities is the fundamental problem. Political parties have to be made accountable to the public. They have to be democratic institutions if they are to deserve public money.

How do other democracies handle this?

Sanjay Kumar: There are some 34 countries where state funding of elections is available in some form or the other. The highest proportion of state funding of elections is in Norway, which is about 74% of the total expenses on the election. But there are different models. In some countries only parties get the fund, candidates do not. There are countries where it’s the other way round.

Jagdeep Chhokar: In most countries where there is public funding of elections, there are also strict transparency requirements. In the U.S., there is a rule that if the presidential candidate raises X amount of money, they are eligible to receive an equal amount of money from the government. But this is subject to certain conditions. In the last two or three presidential elections, no candidate has accepted government money. They have said that they do not want to accept these conditions and that they are able to raise enough money on our own. The point is, if there is to be any public funding of elections, I, as a member of the public, would insist on complete transparency about the money spent by the party or the candidate in the election. If a candidate or a party is allowed to accept other money in addition to public money, there is a very serious problem. And that is the reason why no political party has taken it forward."

President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday said the Comptroller & Auditor General team, as a facilitator of good governance, would play an important role in making India the third largest economy in the world.

After inaugurating the 3rd Audit Diwas celebrations, Ms. Murmu said under the leadership of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, Girish Chandra Murmu, the government’s audit community had made significant contributions to strengthening integrity, governance and system building.

The President said the auditing body had taken several forward looking steps, including the establishment of the Centre for Data Management and Analytics, in which digital technology and other modern methods are being used in line with future requirements. She said the auditors should be considered as facilitators of good governance, not critics.

Stating that India’s leading position in the world community was also visible in the field of audit, she said the emphasis on the issues of Blue Economy and Responsible Artificial Intelligence during India’s presidency of Supreme Audit Institutions 20 (SAI 20) was a good effort to prepare a roadmap for the future.

Speaking on the occasion, the CAG said the institution had made significant progress on multiple fronts. “The audit report catalyses good governance and assists Parliament and State legislatures in ensuring accountability, transparency and efficient functioning of the executive,” he said, adding that 183 audit reports were presented in Parliament and State legislatures during 2022-23.

He said access to financial data had significantly improved with the integration of SAI accounting offices with State governments’ financial systems. “We will continue to strengthen the linkages between Accounts and Audit by developing data analytics capacities for financial analysis,” he said, adding that the move would help produce more informed audits and result in greater public financial management outcomes.

He said “We are setting up an International Centre for Local Government Audit & Capacity Building. This first-of-its-kind institute will be dedicated exclusively for fulfilling a global need for capacity building in respect of local governance audits.”

To address the problem of shortage of qualified accountants in municipalities and panchayats, a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the CAG and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India to conduct a certification course.

On sustainable development, he said: “Our commitment to sustainability is evidenced by the successful preparation of Asset Accounts on Mineral and Energy Resources of States/UTs under the guidance of the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board (GASAB) and the offices of SAI India. Water Resources is the next priority area. GASAB has already developed tentative tables of Water Accounts and circulated them to all States and UTs and other stakeholders.”

As part of the 3rd Audit Day celebrations, the CAG has organised a three-day event from November 15 to 17. The two-day 31st Accountants General conference commenced on Thursday."

“The government is considering several measures such as a flexible framework for sale of products manufactured in special economic zones (SEZs) in the domestic market, easy de-notification norms, and streamlining approval processes for units,” an official said.

The aim is to help revive SEZs and facilitate business transactions between SEZ and domestic tariff area (DTA) or the domestic market. SEZs are enclosures which are treated as foreign territories for trade and customs duties, with restrictions on duty-free sales outside these zones in the domestic market.

To seek views of different Ministries on these measures, the Commerce Ministry has circulated a note on a draft SEZ (Special Economic Zone) Amendment Bill 2023.

The inter-Ministerial consultation is going at a fast pace and the Bill is likely to be introduced in the forthcoming Winter session of Parliament which will commence on December 4 and continue till December 22.

“This Amendment Bill will be introduced in place of the proposed Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs (DESH) Bill,” an official said.

""The Amendment Bill is aimed to help revive SEZs and facilitate business transactions between SEZ and DTA. It proposes to allow sales from SEZ to DTA on duty foregone basis; permitting partial de-notification of zones; easier notification norms; streamlining of approval for SEZs units,"" the official added.

Recently, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said the government is looking at easing certain restrictions for units in SEZs to promote the sector's growth.

Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) in a report has suggested the government to allow sale of products manufactured in SEZs in the domestic market on payment of duty foregone on inputs as that would help promote value addition.

At present, units in SEZs are allowed to sell their products in DTA on payment of duties on an output basis (finished goods). GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said the government already allows DTA sales on payment of duty foregone on input basis to firms operating under the Manufacturing and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) scheme.

The government can ""extend the same concession to the SEZs for parity sake. This will encourage value addition within the SEZ, as in most cases, the tariff on finished products is higher than on inputs,"" Mr. Srivastava said.

He added that SEZ units could be incentivised to increase value addition to avail the benefit of DTA sales, which could further enhance technological advancement and skill development.

Companies or units operating within SEZs are allowed to import materials and components duty-free, with the condition that the finished goods produced are meant to be exported out of India and sold in the Indian domestic market on payment of applicable duties on the output.

SEZs have emerged as an important contributor to India's exports. Total exports from these zones stood at $155.8 billion in 2022-23. These included $61.6 billion of merchandise and $94.2 billion of service exports."
74,The Hindu,India to emerge as third largest global economy by 2027: Finance ...,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-gaza-conflict-challenge-to-us-backed-economic-corridor-fm-sitharaman/article67535054.ece,,"November 15, 2023 01:23 pm | Updated 04:34 pm IST

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on November 15 said India is expected to overtake Japan and Germany to emerge as the third largest economy in the world by 2027.

Addressing the Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue here, Ms. Sitharaman said India's economic growth is estimated to be just under 7% during the year, the highest among major economies, despite global headwinds.

The Indian economy is therefore on the right track and is heading towards a bright future, she said.

Amidst supply-chain disruptions and economic turbulence due to contemporary conflicts that impact the Indo-Pacific, irrespective of whether they are occurring in relatively distant Ukraine or in relatively-proximate Israel or Yemen, and despite the palpable tensions prevalent in the South- and East China Sea, the Indian economy stands out as a bright spot, she said.

""Even according to the usually conservative estimates of the IMF, the Indian economy is set to emerge as the world's third largest economy by 2027, hopping over Japan and Germany, as its GDP crosses the $5 trillion level. By 2047, India aspires to be a developed economy,"" she said.

Talking about India's 'Blue economy', she said, it accounts for roughly 4% of the GDP and represents a sea of opportunities.

India has nine States and four Union Territories situated on the coast, 12 major and 200+ non-major ports situated along its coastline, and a vast network of navigable waterways for international and domestic trade, she said.

According to the UNCTAD, India was the second largest exporter of ocean-based goods and services among developing countries in 2020.

Observing that Indo-Pacific is undoubtedly the world's most economically dynamic region, Ms. Sitharaman said it encompasses 60% of global GDP, and almost 50% of global merchandise trade.

On the other hand, the Indo-Pacific is also a geopolitically contested space that is being roiled by great power competition, she said.

""One draws its legitimacy from an internationally accepted and consensually derived rules-based order. India stands firmly and proudly in the vanguard of this system,"" she said.

While the other seeks to discredit and disrupt this consensually derived rules-based order and supplant it with an international order whose rules are generated in an exclusive State, she said.

As India accelerates its economic growth and uplifts its teeming masses, moving them from poverty to prosperity, she said it is registering impressive gains in its comprehensive national power as well as in terms of its international stature.

""Today, Indians 'whether at home or abroad' stand, walk, talk, and act with their heads held high... even as the world appreciates India's achievements and successes and lauds it for its demonstrated resilience amidst multiple crises, we are very clear that we cannot afford to be an inward-leaning power,"" she said.

""Our focus on transitioning from a 'brown' economic model to a 'blue' one and thereafter extrapolating this blue transition across the length and breadth of the Indo-Pacific demands that we shoulder greater and heavier regional responsibilities, and this is precisely what we are doing,"" she said.

India has significantly improved its position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive environment for business, as reflected in several global indices.

Noting that the country's comprehensive national power is going to remain inextricably linked to the ocean, she said India is seized of the pressing need to grow the maritime sector as a whole and the government is determined to provide the requisite support by way of fiscal policy and financial outlay.

""We seek to position India as a hub in new and diversified supply chains and value chains across the Indo-Pacific and, indeed, across the world.

""Towards this end, I am happy to inform you that all sectors of the government are responding exceedingly positively to our new financial policies,"" she said.

In terms of international shipments, she said India's global ranking has risen from 44th place in 2014, to the 22nd rank in 2023.

Similarly, as per the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index report 2023, she said, the 'turn-around time' of Indian ports is now just 0.9 days, which is lower than ports in established maritime centres such Singapore, the UAE, Germany, the USA, Australia, Russia, and South Africa.

""Our experience of the maritime manifestations of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shipping insurance, too, becoming a particular area of policy focus,"" she said.

On the one hand, a 'Marine Cargo Pool' has now been created with the full support of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and domestic insurance companies, to support maritime trade on the other hand the country is improving its strength in shipping arbitration, and in order to reduce India's vulnerability to international sanctions.

To provide greater strategic flexibility in shipping operations, she said ""we are setting up a full-fledged Indian-owned and India-based Protection and Indemnity (P&I) entity that will additionally provide protection to coastal and inland shipping."" On the capacity building front, she said, as many as 31 projects have been identified in nine major ports for monetisation under the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) launched in 2022, with a total estimated CAPEX of ₹14,483 crore ($1.74 billion) for FY 2022-25.

Terming India-Middle East-Europe Connectivity Corridor (IMEC) as one of the most promising connectivity projects, Sitharaman said it will be a win-win situation for all states involved, as it enhances transportation efficiency, reduces logistic costs, increases economic unity, generates employment, and lowers Greenhouse Gas emissions, contributing to a cleaner, safer, better world.

""However, it is not without its geopolitical challenges and the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza is a worrying manifestation of these,"" she said.

The IMEC was signed at the 18th G-20 Summit held in New Delhi in September.

It is a multimodal economic corridor that incorporates multiple networks of shipping, railways, and roadways and will also include electricity cables, high-speed data cables, and a hydrogen pipeline.

The corridor is expected to create a reliable and cost-effective cross-border, ship-to-rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road transport, and facilitate trade and connectivity, leading to the economic integration of South Asia, West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East."

India, the U.S. and 12 other members of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework For Prosperity (IPEF) grouping have signed a supply chain resilience agreement that would provide benefits such as potential shifting of production centres in critical sectors and mitigating risks of economic disruptions from supply chain shocks.

The agreement was signed in San Francisco, where Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal is attending the Ministerial meeting of the IPEF. The agreement would help member countries, including India, to reduce its dependence on China.

The COVID outbreak had severely disrupted the global supply chain, as most countries were dependent on China for various products, including pharma raw materials.

On the social networking platform X, on November 15, Mr. Goyal said: ""India joins U.S. and 12 other IPEF partners to ink the IPEF Supply Chain Resilience Agreement, a first-of-its-kind international agreement that will fortify and strengthen global supply chains; and foster adaptability, stability and sustainability"".

Members of the bloc concluded the negotiations on this agreement, one of the four pillars of the IPEF, on May 27, this year in Detroit.

The other benefits of the pact include supply chain diversification, mobilisation of investments, deeper integration of India in global value chains, support to MSMEs and creation of a seamless regional trade ecosystem, which would facilitate the flow of Indian products.

IPEF was launched jointly by the U.S. and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year in Tokyo.

The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues such as tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except the trade one.

The members are expected to announce the conclusion of talks for clean economy and fair economy pillars also during this week.

Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam are members of the bloc. It would come into force after the implementation of the agreement by any of the five member countries.

According to an official, the Commerce Ministry is expected to hold an outreach programme pan India for domestic industry, explaining the benefits of the agreement and how to utilise that.

Under the agreement, IPEF partners seek to provide a framework to build their collective understanding of significant supply chain risks; improve crisis coordination and response to supply chain disruptions; facilitate cooperation, mobilise investments, promote regulatory transparency in sectors and goods critical to national security and public health and safety. The critical sectors would be identified by the member countries.

To implement and monitor the agreement, the bloc would set up The IPEF Supply Chain Council. The council will meet every year and all the members would have to report on the progress of implementation of the agreement.

Besides the council, the block would set up The IPEF Supply Chain Crisis Response Network and The IPEF Labour Rights Advisory Board.

The network would deal with emergency issues and help partners to seek support during a supply chain disruption and to facilitate information sharing and collaboration among IPEF partners during a crisis, enabling a faster and more effective response that minimises negative effects on their economies.

On the other hand, the advisory board would help members in promoting labour rights in their supply chains."

Mohammed Shami made history on Wednesday, recording the best-ever wicket haul by the Indian bowler in 50-over World Cup history.

Shami’s seven-wicket haul and Virat Kohli’s record 50th ODI century were the highlights as India secured a 70-wicket win over New Zealand in the semifinal of the Cricket World Cup at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.

Shami took seven wickets for 57 runs off 9.5 overs at an economy rate of 5.79.

His lethal spell overshadowed Ashish Nehra’s figures of 6/23 against England in the 2003 World Cup, to be the best-ever by an Indian in WC history.

Shami’s figures are also the fifth-best in World Cup history, with Australia’s Glenn McGrath’s 7/15 against Namibia in 2003 being the best.

The pace veteran also completed 50 World Cup wickets, becoming only the seventh bowler to do so. Shami is also the fastest to get there, reaching the milestone in just 17 innings, surpassing Mitchell Starc’s (Australia) record of 19 innings.

In 17 matches, Shami has 54 wickets at an average of 12.90, an economy rate of over 5 and a strike rate of 15.33. His best bowling figures are 7/57. He is the sixth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament history.

The highest wicket-taker in WC history is Australia’s Glenn McGrath with 71 wickets in 39 matches in his World Cup career.

Shami now has four five-wicket hauls in Cricket World Cup history, the highest by any bowler. Australian left-arm quick Starc has dropped to second spot with three five-wicket hauls.

In six matches of WC 2023 so far, Shami has taken 23 wickets and is at the top of the wicket charts. His wickets have come at an average of 9.13. He has taken three five-fors and a four-wicket haul in the tournament.

On India’s win over the Kiwis on Wednesday, Shami’s childhood coach Mohamed Badrudeen told ANI, “It is a moment of joy for all of us that India has reached the World Cup final. Virat Kohli has played exceptionally well throughout the tournament. Scoring 50 centuries is not humanly possible but he made it happen. Shami has been in his element in the tournament. We all want India to win the final and lift the trophy.”

Earlier, on Wednesday, India opted to bat first and scored 397/4 in their 50 overs. Skipper Rohit Sharma (47 in 29 balls, with four boundaries and four sixes) and Shubman Gill (80 in 66 balls, with eight fours and three sixes) delivered a fine start with a 71-run opening stand.

Also Read: Virat Kohli scores 50th ODI century, breaks Sachin Tendulkar’s record

Virat Kohli (117 in 113 balls, nine fours and two sixes) posted his 50th ODI ton, while Shreyas Iyer (105 in 70 balls, with four boundaries and eight sixes) scored his second-successive WC century, helping India post a massive score. KL Rahul also delivered a 20-ball cameo of 39 runs, with five fours and two sixes.

Tim Southee (3/100) was the pick of the bowlers for the Kiwis. Trent Boult (1/86) also got a wicket.

In the chase of 398, Kiwis lost two early wickets. But a 181-run partnership between Daryl Mitchell (134 in 119 balls, with nine fours and six sixes) and skipper Kane Williamson (69 in 73 balls, with eight centuries and a six) kept Kiwis alive and Indian bowlers sweating for answers. Glenn Phillips also played a valuable knock of 41. However, a two-wicket over by Shami changed the game and Men in Blue bowled exceptionally in the death overs to restrict NZ to 327 in 48.5 overs.

Besides Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj got a wicket apiece.

Shami was adjudged as the ‘Player of the Match’ for his dream spell."
77,The Hindu,The Bihar caste survey and the social justice agenda - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-bihar-caste-survey-and-the-social-justice-agenda/article67533118.ece,,"November 15, 2023 12:16 am | Updated 01:59 am IST

The government of Bihar has taken two historic steps that move it ahead of all other States in the country as well as the central government on the long road to social justice. It has conducted what amounts to a caste census (despite the legal nomenclature of a survey) and made public the population numbers associated with different caste groups. Even more important, it has now revealed, at least partially, the additional data that tell us something about the broad socio-economic status of castes.

However, the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Janata Dal (United) combine may squander its well-earned lead if it falters in the crucial third step — of using the caste survey data to rejuvenate the social justice agenda. Going by the measures announced so far – expansion of reservations to 65% — Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar seems intent on pouring new wine into old bottles.

The new context that frames the social justice agenda in the third decade of the 21st century demands a response that goes beyond the strategies of the 20th century. This new context has four main dimensions.

Providing ‘decent work’

First, there is the global economic situation, where neoliberal policies have re-positioned States as market-enablers while severely constraining their social welfare capabilities. The hard fact is that despite — or because of? — four decades of market-friendly policies, the formal sector of the Indian economy offers less than 8% of all jobs. While reservation remains relevant as a mode of providing representation to marginalised groups, it is hopelessly inadequate as a means for reducing caste inequalities. The challenge — and it is a formidable one — is to imagine new ways of providing on a mass scale what the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls “decent work”.

Second, like many other countries in the world, India today is ruled by an authoritarian regime built around a personality cult focused on a single leader. The important point is that the hegemonic power of this regime is being used to alter the shape of the Indian state like never before in the history of our republic. Core constitutional norms such as the system of checks and balances between different organs of state; or the distinction between government, party and individual leader; or the basic federal structure of the Indian union are being undermined in ways that are already hard to reverse and may soon become irreversible.

An ideological hegemony

Unlike the first two dimensions of the current context, the last two are explicitly related to caste. The third and most visible aspect of our society and polity today is the arrival of an overt and aggressive north-Indian Hindu upper-caste hegemony in the guise of the ideology called Hindutva. This hegemony itself is not new. Indeed, it has been a permanent feature since Independence, with a brief interruption during the 1990s. But while the earlier upper-caste dominance of the Nehru-era wore the garb of secularism and socialism and was neither overt nor aggressive, the Modi-era version is the opposite in each of these respects. Today, we have a violently anti-secular, unabashedly crony-capitalist form of dominance that insists not only on one nation, one leader and one religion but also on there being one and only one way of being Hindu, or even of being Indian. The caste hierarchies of Hinduism are attempted to be folded into a larger Hindu identity shaped by the upper castes, and defined by a visceral hatred towards Muslims and, to a lesser extent, towards Christians.

The fourth dimension — the most challenging from the point of view of social justice — has to do with the internal differentiations that are now an undeniable aspect of every major caste group. In other words, not only is there more than one class in every caste group but also the interests of these different classes cannot be easily harmonised in a one-dimensional caste politics. The indications are that caste politics will have to become more and more coalitional and address similar class-fractions across multiple castes if it is to remain electorally viable. This may also precipitate a class polarisation within castes with unpredictable consequences. There are intriguing asymmetries here that need to be considered: it is easier for upper caste politics to deal with the problem of poor upper castes than it is for lower caste politics to deal with the problem of rich lower castes. The former goes with the grain of democratic politics in general, while the latter is against the grain.

The ruling coalition in Bihar stands at a historic crossroads. It has the opportunity to inaugurate a new kind of caste politics that takes account of the various dimensions of our present. To do this, the habits of the past will have to be broken, while maintaining continuity with the core of the social justice agenda. The crucial point, obscured in the past but highlighted by the current conjuncture, is that caste politics can no longer be automatically equated with the politics of social justice. If this equation was taken for granted in the past, it was largely because of a misrecognition — itself prompted by the dominant upper caste ideology — that “caste politics” effectively meant lower caste politics. While the immediate effect of this misrecognition was to make upper caste politics invisible, it also shielded lower caste politics from critical scrutiny.

Effective counter-assertion of State rights

On the other hand, the politics of the lower castes, even when it is not fighting for social justice but for the interests of a particular community, can still be an effective counter to the politics of Hindutva, which is the current avatar of the politics of the upper caste neo-elites. Bihar has already been playing this role to some extent by halting the triumphant march of Hindutva politics across north India. Along with Karnataka, Kerala and Rajasthan in recent times, Bihar has also led the resistance against the erosion of Indian federalism. The very act of conducting a caste count was an assertion of the rights of States to fashion locally-relevant policies.

The survey itself raises questions that will profoundly affect our collective future as a nation. A census is ultimately about aggregated numbers, and as such, it privileges larger numbers — in other words, it carries the seed of majoritarianism. In the context of a majority-rule electoral system, the counting of identities like castes seems to juxtapose the “portrait” model of representation against a “proxy” model. Should our political representatives be judged by how well they resemble us (like a portrait), or by how well they act on our behalf (like proxies)? Bihar has the opportunity to show us that even if sharing the same identity is a necessary condition for representation today, it must not be accepted as sufficient.

Chief negotiators of India and the U.K. are expected to soon hold next round of talks for the proposed free trade agreement to iron out differences on issues such as automobiles, medical devices, and movement of professionals, an official said.

The official said that the U.K. team may come to New Delhi for the 14th round of negotiations so that the talks can be concluded at the earliest.

""Virtual sessions are progressing. But we are planning for a full fledged round of talks. In the full round, both sides discuss all the chapters. Some 60-70 sessions happen parallelly,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said.

Issues which need resolution include rules of origin; intellectual property rights (IPRs); social security agreement; duty concessions on electric vehicles, scotch whiskey, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items; liberalisation of norms in services sectors like banking and insurance.

Talks are also progressing on the proposed bilateral investment treaty (BIT).

The investment treaty is being negotiated as a separate agreement between India and the U.K..

These investment treaties help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's country. The main point of contention involved in this pact is about the mechanism for the settlement of disputes.

BITs help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's countries.

India has proposed to first utilise all local judicial remedies for settlement of disputes before initiating an international arbitration.

India and the U.K. launched the talks for free-trade agreement (FTA) in January 2022, with an aim to conclude talks by Deepavali (October 24, 2022), but the deadline was missed due to political developments in the U.K.

There are 26 chapters in the agreement, which include goods, services, investments and intellectual property rights.

The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT, and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duties.

On the other hand, the U.K. is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, automobiles, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items.

Britain is also looking for more opportunities for U.K. services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services (banking and insurance).

The bilateral trade between India and the U.K. increased to $20.36 billion in 2022-23 from $17.5 billion in 2021-22.

The 'rules of origin' provision prescribes minimal processing that should happen in the FTA country so that the final manufactured product may be called originating goods in that country.

Under this provision, a country that has inked an FTA with India cannot dump goods from some third country in the Indian market by just putting a label on it. It has to undertake a prescribed value addition in that product to export to India. Rules of origin norms help contain dumping of goods."

The short-term economic prospects (of India) is good and growth will be steady in the medium term, upwards of 6%. But, beyond 2030, there are some challenges to be addressed, said V. Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor, Government of India, in Coimbatore on Tuesday.

Addressing the members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) on “India’s Economic Growth Story”, he said India was on track to achieve 6.5% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth this year. Better balance sheets, digital public infrastructure leading to financial inclusion, etc., will ensure steady medium-term growth.

However, in the long term, India has to make sure the population is healthy, well educated, and skilled. The poorer and younger population should find employment, and governance continues to improve. Another important medium-term challenge is energy security and energy transition because of climate change. The global debate is about switching to renewable energy. This transition to renewable energy will require, paradoxically, more energy, Mr. Nageswaran said.

One area to be addressed by the industry, in the long term, is spending on research and development (R&D). India’s spend on R&D as a percentage of GDP in financial year 2018 was 0.7%. “We do not think of investment in R&D expenditure as future profitability insurance.”

India’s supply side infrastructure has improved, balance sheets of companies have become better, and its digital revolution is another silver lining, he added. Advanced digital infrastructure brings formalisation of the economy, financial inclusion, and access to markets.

“We are at the cusp of a major transformation in efficiencies, market access, and financial inclusion because of the digital advancements that we have been able to achieve in a short span of time. In terms of addressing long term structural issues, these things need to be implemented much better. They are on a slow lane right now. They will have to get on to a fast lane, whether it be asset monetisation, logistics, codifying labour laws, and public sector enterprise policy. All these things need to get on to the fast lane, which I expect will happen post election,” he said."

India’s economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1% annually in fiscal years 2024-2026, S&P Global Ratings said on November 16.

In a report titled ‘Global Banks Country-By-Country Outlook 2024’, S&P said the banking sector’s weak loans will decline to 3-3.5% of gross advances by March 31, 2025, on the back of structural improvement, including healthy corporate balance sheets, tighter underwriting standards and improved risk-management practices.

Interest rates in India are unlikely to rise materially, and this should limit the risk for the banking industry, it added.

“Unsecured personal loans have grown rapidly and could contribute to incremental NPLs. We believe underwriting standards for retail loans generally remain healthy and overall level of delinquencies remains within acceptable limits for this product category,” S&P Primary Credit Analyst Deepali Seth Chhabria said.

The report said that global uncertainties will have a lesser impact on the Indian economy.

Slower global growth and external demand will weigh on economic activity and could fuel further inflation. However, given that India is domestically oriented, the agency expects the economic growth to be less affected, it added.

“Economic growth momentum to continue. India’s economic growth prospects should remain strong over the medium term, with GDP expanding 6-7.1% annually in fiscal years 2024-2026,” S&P said.

India’s real GDP rose 7.8% year-on-year in the June quarter, up from 6.1% in the March quarter.

The Reserve Bank of India has forecast a 6.5% economic growth for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscal years.

The report further said that the State Bank of India and the leading private-sector banks have largely addressed their asset-quality challenges.

Many public-sector banks still carry relatively high volumes of weak assets, which will result in higher credit losses and hit profitability; their performance lags that of the industry."
81,The Hindu,Should elections be state funded? - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/should-elections-be-state-funded/article67540233.ece,,"A Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, D.Y. Chandrachud, recently reserved its judgment on petitions challenging the validity of the electoral bonds scheme. The proceedings focused on arguments pertaining to the voters’ right to information vis-a-vis the right to confidentiality of donors. Transparency in election funding has become the central issue here. Should elections be state funded instead? Jagdeep Chhokar and Sanjay Kumar discuss the question in a conversation moderated by Sreeparna Chakrabarty. Edited excerpts:

Can state funding of elections bring in transparency in the poll process?

Jagdeep Chhokar: First, calling it state funding of elections is a misnomer. It should be called public funding of elections. I say this because in India, we unfortunately have a notion that whatever the state does is free. If there is such funding, it will be public money that the state will be giving for elections. So, if we call it public funding of elections, my sense is that people will feel that it is their money, which is the truth.

Public funding of elections can certainly bring transparency in the poll process, but it depends on how it is done. If public money is given to political parties and candidates, and let’s say they are also welcome to get money from wherever they like, then there are serious issues. Public funding in principle is a good idea, but the mechanics of it need to be fleshed out.

Sanjay Kumar: I think it would be a welcome step, but I’m not sure whether it will bring about transparency in the electoral process because we need to look at the nitty-gritty of how this is going to be worked out, we need to look at what state funding means.

It would certainly be better than the existing system where candidates and political parties spend from their own pocket and a lot of black money goes into election campaigning. State funding of elections will help bring some transparency. But I’m not sure whether the entire electoral process will become transparent with state funding of elections alone.

Four reports have looked into the viability of state funding of elections. The Indrajit Gupta Committee Report, the Law Commission of India Report of 1999, the Report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission in 2008, and the National Commission to review the working of the Constitution Report of 2001. The first three said that state funding is desirable to an extent. Is it viable for the Indian economy?

Jagdeep Chhokar: We can discuss viability provided we agree that public funding is desirable, which I think it is. You mentioned four reports. If you read the Indrajit Gupta Committee Report, which is most often quoted in support of public funding of elections, it says state funding should be done only in kind and not in cash. It also says that state funding of elections would be a waste of public resources unless it is accompanied by factors such as democratisation of political parties and decriminalisation of the political process. It says unless there is internal democracy in political parties, state funding of elections will be a waste of public money. So, it lays down conditions under which public funding of elections can be, and should be, considered, and not necessarily adopted. State funding is viable only if parties are internally and demonstrably democratic in their functioning, transparent in their financial affairs, and there is a reliable mechanism of ensuring that parties and candidates do not accept money from other sources.

Now, if there is public funding of elections, how much provision should we make for that? If an amount is to be set aside for public funding of elections, we need to know how much money was spent in the last election. That number depends on a couple of factors. First, the money that the Election Commission of India spent. This data is available and reasonably accurate. Second, the amount spent by political parties and candidates. This figure is known only to political parties and candidates who contest elections.

Professor Kumar, the Indrajit Gupta Committee had said that whatever funding is given should be in kind, such as free transport. How would this work? And is it possible to explore a system which is partially public funded?

Sanjay Kumar: People need to discuss this because the question is about a possibility. Is this possible or not? I think it is possible. You have to work out a model. We cannot say this is not possible at all or that this is perfectly alright. Political parties need to be part of the decision-making process.

A few years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a discussion on public funding of elections. Before that, the Congress had also raised it. But nothing has come out of these statements. Why have parties never taken this issue forward?

Sanjay Kumar: Political parties support it because state funding of elections is seen as socially desirable or desirable in the electoral context. But they have not been able to move ahead with this because at the moment, this is just a concept. Nobody is clear about how it is to be worked out.

Also, is it a case that except the two large national parties, most political parties, especially regional parties, have now become family-oriented?

Sanjay Kumar: How does that relate to state funding of elections? Suppose the government decides to give ₹100 crore to political parties for poll contests. How will this amount be distributed? The benchmark should be the party’s performance in the last Lok Sabha or Assembly elections, not whether the party is being headed by a family member or not.

Also read | A vote for state funding

Jagdeep Chhokar: I am amused that Professor Kumar is saying or at least implying that the party which gets more votes should get more money. That if Party A won or got more votes in the last election, it should get more money for this election. If that party then has more money than the parties that have lost, it will be an uneven playing field.

Sanjay Kumar: I was only stating a limited point that if the funding is to be supported by the government, the criteria cannot be whether a party is being headed by a family or a party which has a democratically elected leader. There have to be different criteria, and I was just citing an example. I’m not saying that the party which has performed better should get more money or a party which has performed poorly should get less. Things can be worked out. This could be one possibility. But my intervention was to another point: if a party has a leader who is democratically elected, we can’t say there should be different criteria for giving funds to that party while parties which are family parties should be punished with less funds.

Jagdeep Chhokar: It is problematic to say that the money to be given to political parties depends on their electoral performance. No party today functions as a political party. Political parties function as corporates. Their business is to win elections and make money to be able to win the next elections. So, this functioning of political parties as corporate entities or as family-run corporate entities is the fundamental problem. Political parties have to be made accountable to the public. They have to be democratic institutions if they are to deserve public money.

How do other democracies handle this?

Sanjay Kumar: There are some 34 countries where state funding of elections is available in some form or the other. The highest proportion of state funding of elections is in Norway, which is about 74% of the total expenses on the election. But there are different models. In some countries only parties get the fund, candidates do not. There are countries where it’s the other way round.

Jagdeep Chhokar: In most countries where there is public funding of elections, there are also strict transparency requirements. In the U.S., there is a rule that if the presidential candidate raises X amount of money, they are eligible to receive an equal amount of money from the government. But this is subject to certain conditions. In the last two or three presidential elections, no candidate has accepted government money. They have said that they do not want to accept these conditions and that they are able to raise enough money on our own. The point is, if there is to be any public funding of elections, I, as a member of the public, would insist on complete transparency about the money spent by the party or the candidate in the election. If a candidate or a party is allowed to accept other money in addition to public money, there is a very serious problem. And that is the reason why no political party has taken it forward."

83,The Hindu,Understanding worker productivity and how it relates to economic ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/understanding-worker-productivity-and-how-it-relates-to-economic-growth-explained/article67490775.ece,,"November 02, 2023 10:54 pm | Updated November 03, 2023 05:11 pm IST

The story so far: Citing Japan and Germany as examples of countries that grew because their citizens worked harder and for longer hours to rebuild their nations in the aftermath of the Second World War, Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy sparked a debate recently, urging young Indians to work 70 hours per week. He further noted that India’s worker productivity is one of the lowest in the world.

What is worker productivity? Is it the same as labour productivity?

The only conceptual difference between the two is that the ‘work’ in worker productivity describes mental activities while the ‘work’ in labour productivity is mostly associated with manual activities. Productivity of an activity is usually measured as the quantum of output value per unit of labour (time) cost at a micro level. At a macro level, it is measured in terms of the labour-output ratio or change in Net Domestic Product (NDP) per worker in each sector (where working hours are assumed to be 8 hours per day).

However, in certain types of services, especially ones involving intellectual labour, measuring the value of the output independently is very difficult, so the income of workers is usually taken as proxies to suggest productivity. Therefore, the statement by Mr. Murthy, which conveys that by increasing the total number of working hours, productivity or the value of the quantum of work done per unit of labour (time) can increase, looks fallacious. The only way this can happen is if the additional quantum of work done and output value produced has no commensurate pay. While this may seem normal for someone who wishes to maximise profits, it can otherwise be seen as a repulsively crude appetite for increasing profits at the expense of the workers.

Productivity in a more sophisticated usage is an attribute not of time but of skill. Human capital (a more reductionist version of Human Development) including education, training, nutrition, health etc., enhances the ability of labour to become more productive, or churn out greater quantum of value within the same number of working hours. Based on this understanding, the reduction in the number of working hours does not hamper the value of output produced, but in turn enhances the leisure and quality of life of workers in real terms, while the value added to the economy could still be increasing, nominal wages remaining the same.

Is there a direct link between worker productivity and economic growth?

While an increase in productivity made through any sector is likely to affect the value added and the accumulation or growth in the economy, the relationship between the two could be quite complex.

If by prosperity we intend to suggest prosperity of the workers, this may or may not be true. In 1980, India’s Gross Domestic Product was about $200 billion, which by 2015 exceeded $2,000 billion. However, in terms of the distribution of income across groups in India, Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty have shown that during 1980-2015, where the share in the national income of 40% of the middle income group and 50% of the low income group in India had decreased from 48% to 29% and 23% to 14% respectively, the top 10% income groups share had increased from 30% to 58%.

This effectively means that the income groups in the bottom 50% in India experienced an increase in their income from 1980 to 2015 by 90%, whereas income groups in the top 10% experienced an increase in income by 435%. The top 0.01% has had an increase of 1699% percent from 1980 to 2015 and the top 0.001% have had an increase of 2040%. Chancel and Piketty note that the increase in incomes or the prosperity of the richest people is not quite explained by their productivity. On the contrary, this prosperity is either linked to hereditary transfers of wealth upon which the rich are earning yields (he called this patrimonial capitalism) or to the ‘super managerial’ class who seem to be deciding their own exorbitant pay packages, quite arbitrarily, not related in any way to their productivity. While Mr. Murthy might have worked quite hard, the class he belongs to in general seems to be holding a value, which in no way is either linked to productivity or value contributions based on skill and effort. This delinking of productivity and rewards is in fact one of the worries about the legitimacy of the capitalist class order in contemporary times which Piketty expresses.

Does India have one of the ‘lowest worker productivity’ in the world?

As incomes are seen as a proxy for productivity, there is a fallacious inference about productivity of workers in India being low. The question as to why over the years, beginning with the 1980s, the share of wages and salaries have declined while the share of profits has increased, perhaps is linked to the informalisation of employment, labour laws and the development and regulation regime becoming unfavourable to workers.

Kronos Incorporated, a U.S based multi-national workforce management firm, has in fact observed that Indians are among the most hard working employees in the world. On the other hand, Picodi.com an international ecommerce platform has observed that India ranks one of the lowest in terms of average wages per month globally. Therefore, Mr. Murthy’s statement does not seem to be backed by facts. It seems to be part of an effort to push further labour reforms unfavourable to the workers by creating a false narrative.

Interestingly, Mr. Narayana Murthy has found support from Sajjan Jindal, the Managing Director of JSW Steel. While the Chinese are producing steel and selling them at a 40% lower cost, Indian entrepreneurs in this sector, and the metal sector in general, are choosing to move out of higher end activities of manufacturing to the back-end activities of mining and smelting. Here it is the entrepreneurs who must take the blame for low productivity.

Does having a high informal labour pool complicate the calculation of worker productivity and its correlation to GDP?

Yes. Informal employment in both the unorganised as well as the organised sectors has been on the rise through the course of economic reforms. The dubious claim of increased formalisation has been limited only to bringing activities under the tax net. This has however had no impact on improving labour standards or working conditions.

Even in the formal manufacturing sector you find an overwhelming presence of Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) which are labour intensive. Studies have also found that there is a systematic process of cost cutting through wage cutting in these enterprises. However, since high labour productivity combined with low wages fetch high profits, there can be no other explanation, but for exploitation of the workers, for why this segment becomes the preferred mode of investment. In fact, large number of large-scale corporations have been found to outsource and sub-contract production to these smaller units, in India as well as globally. This is true with the IT sector as well.

Are the comparisons of India’s economy with those of Japan and Germany economies apt?

These comparisons don’t seem to enable serious analysis. Japan and Germany are neither comparable in terms of the size and quality of labour force nor in terms of the nature of their technological trajectories or their socio-cultural and political structures. India presents a unique case and any arbitrary comparison would only lead to dubious analytical inferences and fallacious policy prescripts. Enhancing social investments, focusing on exploring domestic consumption potential for increased productivity with a human centric assessment of development achievements is the way to a more sustainable and desirable outcome.

In early 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to unveil a road map to transform the country into a developed nation with a $30 trillion economy by the time it completes 100 years of Independence. The Vision India@2047 plan, as it is officially named, has been in the works for nearly two years with officials across ministries brainstorming on how to take the country from its current level of development to where it aspires to be. The NITI Aayog, in the process of giving this vision document a final shape, will soon run its central ideas and goals past top minds across sectors, including World Bank President Ajay Banga, Apple chief Tim Cook, as well as Indian industrialists and thought leaders, to finetune them and factor in any blind spots. Coming ahead of the Lok Sabha election, the plan may well be viewed as the government’s policy playbook promise for prospective voters. But irrespective of electoral outcomes, future governments would do well to keep an earnest outlook towards the broad agenda. India’s rise from 1991, when it accounted for 1.1% of the global economic output, to the 3.5% share it now commands as the world’s fifth largest economy, has been driven by governments of varying political hues largely sticking to the reform and liberalisation agenda. Blips in the pace and vigour of reforms have also been visible across governments, including the present coalition-independent regime, especially on the trickier changes needed in factor markets such as land and labour.

The final plan should have some ideas to help navigate such challenging reforms and ensure policy certainty for global investors keen to bet on India’s growth story. Minimising the government’s role to that of an enabler rather than a micro-manager, is another detail that would be critical, especially as some recent decisions have marked a hark back to habits of the past, be it production-linked incentives, import licensing or overtly zealous taxation. A stated focus area of the vision document that splices its action points and outcome goals into two periods — 2030, and the 17 year-period from then till 2047 — is to ensure that India does not slip into a middle income trap a few years from now. That requires hastening the long-pursued structural shift in the economy from farms to factories, and arresting a widening trend of income inequality. While the Five-Year Plans have been abandoned, the 2047 plan must be revisited at suitable intervals to recalibrate goals based on evolving global trends and Black Swan events. Aiming for a high 9% growth rate between 2030 and 2047 is laudable but factoring in alternative scenarios and changing course when warranted, is also advisable."

Director for Indo-French Centre for Promotion of Advanced Research Nitin Seth has called upon graduating candidates to play a bigger role in the transformation of the nation by shifting the focus from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Made by India’

Delivering the address at the 73rd annual convocation of Karnatak University in Dharwad on Monday, he said that it was right time for the youths to be part of a big milestone, when the Indian economy was all set to witness a big leap to five trillion economy.

Mr. Seth said that transformation from 37 billion economy in 1960 to the present 3.70 trillion economy was because of the dedicated efforts of all including manufacturers, service providers, farmers, teachers, doctors, scientists, and also students.

“The world has realised the power of Indian talents and Indians head many top companies in the world. Contributions from India in field of science and technology, particularly mathematics, astronomy, metallurgy, ayurveda, culture, and yoga and medicine are very well appreciated,” he said.

Mr. Seth emphasised the role of youths in the current scenario at a time when the world was looking at India for solutions in various fields. India had achieved a rightful and respectable place in global competition because of indigenously developed capabilities in knowledge in various fields, he said adding that the youths would be strong players in building an aspirational and self-reliant India.

Higher Education Minister M.C. Sudhakar said that Karnatak University being the second oldest university in the State, had carved a niche for itself in the field of education by producing several luminaries who have contributed a great deal to the state and the country.

Referring to the challenges being faced by the university at present, he said that government would solve the financial problems of the university and shortage of staff in a phased manner.

Governor Thawaarchand Gehlot and Mr. Sudhakar honoured President of Basava Samiti Arvind Jatti, philanthropist and alumni of the university Ravishankar Bhoopalapur, and educationist Archana Surana by presenting them honorary doctorates.

Presiding over the convocation, Mr. Gehlot emphasised the need for youths to contribute towards making the country self reliant. He called on them to join hands with the Union government in making the country a superpower by the centenary year of India’s independence.

A total of 250 gold medals were shared by 109 candidates while 264 candidates received doctoral degrees in various streams. Vice-Chancellor K.B. Gudasi briefed about the achievements of the university. Deans of various streams, and officials were present.

High drama

As the convocation was about to conclude, the candidates who were to receive doctoral degrees created high drama, demanding that the Governor should award them the doctoral degrees. Although Mr. Gudasi tried to reason with them saying that their degrees would be awarded in the post lunch session, they were in no mood to listen and insisted on receiving their degrees from the Governor and raised slogans. They stopped sloganeering only after the Governor responding positively to their demand."

A reflexive cheer of India as the fastest-growing major economy rang out when the National Statistics Office (NSO) announced in late August that GDP had increased in the April-June quarter at an annual rate of 7.8%. The most euphoric cheerleaders predicted growth to accelerate to 8%. Even conservative forecasters routinely project GDP growth between 6% and 7%.

This GDP-centric framing of alleged Indian economic success is wrong-headed. GDP is a flawed metric of national economic welfare. It hides inequalities and deflects attention from acute job scarcity, poor education and health, unlivable cities, a broken judicial system, and environmental damage. Feverish celebrations of India’s large but unequally distributed GDP hide the struggles of large numbers of people; large GDP is not purchasing power.

For India, ‘fastest-growing’ growing GDP should be a trivial achievement. Just as a 10-year-old child gains height more rapidly than a 20-year-old adult, India as the poorest of the major economies should grow fastest. Embarrassingly, it has failed to consistently do so. In fact, contrary to the hype, GDP growth has slowed sharply over the past two decades. The problem has been weak mass demand.

Pre-COVID and post-COVID

Indian GDP grew at an annual 9% rate in the mid-2000s as historically high world trade growth lifted all economies. A financial sector-real estate-construction bubble added froth to that growth. This was unsustainable. Growth slowed to 6% after the global financial crisis of 2007-08 as world trade decelerated quickly. By 2012-13, GDP growth had fallen to about 4.5%, but growth for that year and the next three jumped courtesy of a mysterious data revision in January 2015. Cleverly juggled statistics, however, could help only so much. The slowdown resumed after the demonetisation and botched GST rollout. And once the finance-real estate bubble collapsed following the IL&FS bankruptcy in August 2018, GDP growth came down to 3.9% in the year before the pandemic.

In fact, the pre-COVID growth was more dire than the publicised estimate implies. Indian statistical authorities present income from production as their measure of GDP. In principle, expenditure on Indian products (by national residents and foreigners) should equal income because producers earn incomes only when someone buys their wares. But expenditure grew at a mere 1.9% in the pre-COVID year.

When income and expenditure growth differ significantly, an average of the two more fairly represents the state of the economy rather than any one measure. By that averaging method, GDP grew by 2.9% in the pandemic year.

The slowdown from the heady 9% GDP growth in the mid-2000s to 3%-4% before the pandemic reflected severe weakness in demand. That weakness manifested in the glaring drop in private corporate fixed investment from a peak of 17% of GDP in 2007-8 to 11% in 2019-20. Private corporations cut back investments recognising that domestic consumers, fearful of job and earning prospects, had constrained purchasing power, and foreigners had only a limited appetite for Indian goods.

In the post-COVID-19 years, the economy has bounced around. It fell sharply, recovered modestly, slowed severely, and experienced a dead cat bounce from late-2022. The only way to assess this bouncy post-COVID phase is by determining the average growth rate over the entire period. Even that is not straightforward. If we consider the latest four quarters over the four quarters before COVID, the annual growth rate (of the income and expenditure average) is 4.2%. If we compare only the latest quarter over the quarter before COVID, the annual growth is just above 2%.

The tell-tale sign of post-COVID demand weakness is the further drop in private corporate investment to 10% of GDP in 2021-22; analysts believe that it has remained anaemic in 2022-23. Investors recognise that while rich Indians, helped by an overvalued rupee, are buying luxury goods, the majority can barely buy necessities.

In response to shrinking mass affordability, producers continue offering ultra-low price staples such as noodles, toothpaste, soaps, soft drinks, and biscuits, but sell them in packages of ever-smaller quantities. In December 2022, the government instituted a year-long free grain programme for nearly three-fifths of the population; analysts expect the programme to persist through the 2024 general elections. Meanwhile, to maintain consumption, households have slashed their savings rates to 5.1% of GDP, from 11.9% in 2019-20. Those eligible for credit cards are racking up worrying levels of debt. And with an overvalued rupee and world trade barely crawling ahead, Indian exports have been falling.

Need to bolster demand

In the glow of a fake high-growth story, government policy has tried to rev-up supply rather than bolster demand through good jobs, more human capital investment, and functional cities. Unsurprisingly, the September 2019 corporate tax cut, sops like PLI schemes, and shiny flyovers and highways have failed to revive corporate investment. Increased fiscal reliance on indirect taxes, which erode purchasing power, has aggravated demand.

A sober analysis of GDP growth just before and after COVID points to a medium-term annual GDP growth forecast of 3%-4%. Unfortunately, a domestic elite and international media narrative of “high growth” will continue, as will policies in opposition to India’s needs. And when narrative and reality clash repeatedly, tragedy follows.

The story so far: The Indian economy, measured in terms of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as Gross Value-Added (GVA), grew 7.8% between April and June (first quarter or Q1) this year, a four quarter-high. The Finance Ministry believes the momentum of economic activity was carried forward in the July-September quarter, despite retail inflation hardening to 6.4% from 4.7% in Q1 thanks to a spike in food prices. Growth estimates for Q2 will come in next month, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects GDP growth to moderate to 6.5%. A week into the second half of the year, the Israel-Palestine conflict erupted and a spate of fresh dark clouds now hover over the economy.

How have experts reacted to recent events?

Economists feel a prolonged conflict in West Asia could push crude oil prices beyond India’s comfort zone and if other countries join the fray, critical sea routes could face disruptions and spike transport and insurance costs. The government may not pass on higher petroleum prices to consumers ahead of critical elections, but producers’ costs may still rise. Airlines, for instance, have been hiking fares in line with aviation turbine fuel costs. Moreover, higher fuel import bills could pose implications on the exchequer as oil marketing companies may need support for under-recoveries. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her first remarks since the strife in Gaza, said it has brought concerns about fuel, food security and supply chains back to the forefront. She flagged concerns about the impact of any disruptions on inflation in the near future. In subsequent comments, she has also emphasised the need to ensure that global food, fertilizer and fuel supplies did not become an “instrument of war and disruption”.

The RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, who chaired a monetary policy review hours before Hamas launched the first salvo in the conflict, summed up the emerging situation eloquently. “We all thought that the period of uncertainties is over, but as you would have seen in the last fortnight, new uncertainties have been thrown up while some that already existed, like oil prices and volatility in financial markets, have got more pronounced,” he said last Friday. Among the new uncertainties, he listed the spurt in U.S. bond yields that hit a 16-year high this month and mixed global data points amid fears of “higher for longer” interest rates. A cut in India’s interest rate is not on the cards, he emphasised. “Interest rates will remain high… how long… only time and the way the world is evolving, will tell.” Higher interest rates can impact investment flows in markets like India.

Is there a shift in the assessment of risks for the economy?

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its 2023-24 GDP growth estimate for India to 6.3% this month from 6.1% estimated earlier. This is just slightly below the 6.5% GDP uptick the Finance Ministry and the RBI have penned in for this year, following last year’s 7.2% growth. In its monthly economic review report released last month, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in the Finance Ministry said it was comfortable with the 6.5% hopes “with symmetric risks”. Bright spots of corporate profitability, private sector capital formation, bank credit growth and construction sector activity offset the risks at the time. These included steadily climbing crude oil prices (“but no alarms yet”) and an overdue global stock market correction, which it termed “an ever-present risk”. The RBI, this month, also asserted that risks from the uneven monsoon, geopolitical tensions, global market volatility and economic slowdown, were “evenly balanced”. The RBI expects GDP growth to slow to 6% in the current quarter, and further to 5.7% in January to March 2024 before picking up to 6.6% in Q1 of 2024-25. Governor Das has since exuded confidence in the overall macro fundamentals of the Indian economy, despite the uncertainties that have emerged this month.

Last Monday, in its latest economy review, the DEA noted that though domestic fundamentals are strong and improving, downside risks arise from global headwinds that have been compounded by recent developments in the Persian Gulf, and uncertainties in weather conditions due to El Niño effects. “Depending on how the situation develops, crude oil prices may push higher. Further, the relentless supply of U.S. Treasuries and continued restrictive monetary policy in the U.S. (with further monetary policy tightening not ruled out) could cause financial conditions to be restrictive,” it said. It was also prescient about the U.S. stock markets having a greater correction risk, which would have spillover effects on other markets. India’s stock markets clocked six straight days of sharp declines before a marginal recovery was seen this Friday. The DEA has flagged a broader worry about fraught geopolitical conditions triggering a surge in risk aversion. “If these risks worsen and are sustained, they can affect economic activity in other countries, including India,” it noted, even as it averred that India’s growth story remained on track. Inflation had eased to 5% in September from a 15-month high of 7.4% in July and the department highlighted higher upticks in industrial capacity utilisation levels, private consumption and investment, retail loans extended for vehicles and housing as bright spots in its economic outlook. The report also cited ‘optimistic’ findings from RBI’s forwarding-looking surveys on manufacturing, consumer confidence, employment and inflation expectations to stress all is well.

What are domestic factors to watch out for?

Inflation may have subsided last month, but could creep back up. The RBI, which expects average inflation of 5.4% through 2023-24, has penned in a 5.6% average uptick in prices for the October to December quarter and 5.2% for the first six months of 2024. While some vegetable prices have corrected, inflation in onions has shot up while for pulses and some cereals, prices are likely to stay high for a while. The IMF and World Bank expect inflation to average even higher at 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively. The RBI’s preferred 4% inflation mark remains elusive as do prospects of interest rate cuts. This doesn’t bode well for a sustained rise in consumption demand that is vital to revive private investments. A Bank of Baroda study on consumption trends shows that production of readymade garments, mobile phones, hair dye, shampoo, cookers and even ice cream, had declined between 12% to 20% in the first five months of this year. “Normally when inflation is high households tend to cut back on discretionary spending which is what is being seen today,” it noted. With pent-up demand effects fading, the next couple of months will determine whether consumption has actually picked up, the Bank’s economists said. Rural demand which has been lagging, will be important, and may come under more pressure if some crops’ output is affected. Last but not the least, an economist from a rating firm said, the upcoming election season could imply some slowdown in public capex in infrastructure that revved up the economy in recent quarters."

Stressing the need for the government and the industry to work in close coordination for economic development of the country, Puducherry Commissioner-cum-Secretary Ashish Madhaorao More, on Thursday said all stakeholders have to come together to make Indian a developed nation and a $5-trillion economy..

Speaking at the MSME Business Conclave organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here, Mr. More said the government and industry will have to work together on ease of doing business, assessing environmental impact, financing business ventures and labour laws.

“The MSMEs will be the main force in making the country a developed nation and a $5 trillion economy. The sector is the future as it has the potential to provide maximum employment opportunities to local people. It will be the driving force of Indian economy. We will have to be vocal for local but at the same time have to think on a global perspective,” Mr. More, who handles the Industries and Commerce portfolio, said.

The Union Territory, he said, has got a huge potential to build its MSME sector. The region is known for its historical trade ties, he added. “Centuries ago, Puducherry used to trade with the Roman empire and other parts of the world. Places such as Arikamedu stands as an example for the Union Territory’s trade ties. It means, historically, people of the region were enterprising,” he added.

He also urged the Industry to adapt to the technological needs of the present day.

A. Joseph Rosario, Chairman of CII, Puducherry, said the MSME sector plays a vital role in the Indian economy. It contributes nearly 30% to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, accounts for 50% of its total exports and stands third in the country’s manufacturing output.

“It (MSME) not only has a significant economic impact but also drives innovation and creates job opportunities. In the light of the impending technological shift where machines will have a significant presence in the workplace by 2025, there is a need to prioritise skill development for MSME. Identifying and implementing re-skilling and up-skilling initiatives for employees is imperative,” he said.

Vice-Chairman of CII, Puducherry, V. Shanmuganandam and Convenor, Manufacturing and MSME Panel, CII Puducherry J. Thiruvasagam also spoke."

India has completed 75 glorious years of Independence and the Indian economy has grown in the last few decades and today, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. It is the sole responsibility of every individual citizen to see that India become the world’s third largest economy in the coming years, Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot has said.

He was addressing students after distributing degree convocation certificates and Ph.D awards at the 13th annual convocation of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University in Bidar on Monday.

“We all know that with the kind of treasures India has had in those days it was called the Golden Sparrow. Our valiant freedom fighters fought the British to get Independence. We should strive hard to regain India’s past glory,” Mr. Gehlot said.

Mr. Gehlot expressed that the economic condition of the field of animal husbandry and fishing should be improved and suggested that indigenous breeds be promoted. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) has begun to address critical gaps in the fisheries value chain from fish production, productivity and quality to technology, post-harvest infrastructure and marketing.

Stressing the need to protect the environment and create more awareness in this regard, Mr. Gehlot said that “if we use the natural resources in a sustainable manner, only then our future generations will be safe.”

Agriculture development is one of the most powerful tools to end poverty, as growth in the agriculture sector is two to four times more effective in raising incomes among the poorest compared to other sectors, Mr. Gehlot added.

He said that in the last 75 years, India has progressed in every field. Now, agriculture research and new inventions in the farming sector should reach farmers. India should come to the fore in maximum milk production. Agriculture production as well as the income of farmers should increase. He said that agriculture can create investment and employment opportunities.

Mr. Gehlot appealed to every Indian citizen to work tirelessly to make India self-reliant.

Minister for Animal Husbandry and Sericulture K Venkatesh, Deputy Director-General of Indian Agricultural Research Council, New Delhi, A.C. Agrawal, Vice-Chancellor K.C. Veeranna and Registrar S. Shivashankar were present.

Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on November 13 presented his government’s 2024 budget, emphasising the need for tough reforms until the full recovery of the cash-strapped island nation's economy.

Although Sri Lanka has managed to control its hyperinflation in the ongoing economic crisis, its economy is far from being fully recovered.

Sri Lanka cuts policy rates to reduce inflation and boost economic recovery

“We have been able to put back on the rails the derailed economy. Still, people undergo suffering,"" Mr. Wickremesinghe, who is also the Finance Minister, said.

“The inflation which was 70% in September 2022 has been reduced to 1.5% in October this year,"" the Minister said. He said in order for the island nation to prevent another bankruptcy, hard reforms are a must.

The state banks were made to fund the losses of state enterprises. He proposed that two state banks’ shares be issued to the public and investors while the government would inject cash into the state banks to maintain their stability.

Mr. Wickremesinghe said the cost of living allowances for 1.3 million state employees and pensioners numbering 7,00,000 would be raised by Rs.10,000 (Sri Lankan Rupees) and Rs.3,000 respectively from 2024.

In Sri Lanka, a long and rocky road to economic recovery

The announcement came as state employees last week held street protests demanding a Rs.20,000 wage hike. He said the government could no longer print money or get external borrowings for state expenditure.

Mr. Wickremesinghe blamed the political trade union for protests against investment projects such as the Trincomalee oil tanks farm development with India.

“A special Presidential task force would see the development of the entire Trincomalee district with the Indian side,” he said.

Highlighting the revenue shortfall, Mr. Wickremesinghe said there remains a monthly state expenditure deficit of rupees 168 billion with the government having to pay 220 billion as loan interest.

The revenue shortfall was one of the key factors mentioned in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) first review of its 2.9 billion dollar bailout.

The budget speech made no reference to when the second tranche of the IMF four-year bailout would be forthcoming. Mr. Wickremesinghe said this budget was not a 2024 election budget as no popular handouts were announced.

The next Presidential election must be called by mid-September of 2024 and be held before the end of November."

The Indian economy has grown at an impressive rate in the post-COVID-19 years. In FY2023, it grew year-over-year (YoY) at 7.2%, the fastest among major economies. In FY2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects India’s YoY growth at 6.3%, again the fastest among major economies. For those yet to absorb its full import, the tagline, ‘fastest-growing major economy,’ calls for some elaboration.

The word ‘major’ in the tagline makes it clear that India’s relatively high economic growth in the global context is not on account of its small size. India is currently the fifth largest economy in the world in U.S. dollar terms and is projected by the IMF to become the third largest by 2027. An economy as large as this and growing rapidly cannot be characterised by weak domestic demand, particularly when external demand growth has been uneven and uncertain.

COVID-19 and growth rates

Some commentators contest the tagline, ‘fastest’. There is a view that post-COVID-19, YoY growth rates need to be replaced by compound annual growth rate estimated on the pre-COVID-19 year of 2019-20. This view seeks to measure annualised progress as if there was no pandemic. However, the fact is that there was a pandemic, and YoY growth rates measure progress despite the pandemic. In this perspective, the YoY growth rate of 7.2% in FY23 comprises two components: one that measures annualised progress over the pre-pandemic year and the other that measures annual recovery of the output lost to the pandemic. The latter in no way is less significant than the former.

Present-day economic dividends are also rooted in the steps taken to mitigate the economic challenges of the pre-COVID-19 period. In the first decade of this century, the Indian economy grew rapidly, propelled by strong growth in world trade and a domestic credit boom.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-08, growth in world trade fell, dampening the trade stimulus for economies worldwide, including the Indian economy. The domestic credit bubble also burst as high leverage in the corporate sector led to frequent defaults in repayments and a consequent surge in non-performing assets of public sector banks. The twin stresses on the balance sheets combined with elevated prices in real estate led to a lower investment rate in the Indian economy.

Public capex also could not add much to the investment rate as the new government that came to power in 2014 had no choice but to opt for fiscal discipline to address the legacy challenges of large fiscal deficits, high inflation, and a widened current account deficit. With trade and domestic investment weakening, the Indian economy grew at a rate less than its potential in the second decade, except for a couple of years when crude oil prices dropped, improved the trade balance, and supported higher growth.

Government’s measures since 2014

The new government implemented a series of measures to lift the economy onto a higher growth path in the medium term. A calibrated liberalisation of the economy has resulted in an upward-level shift of net foreign direct investment inflows. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) introduced in 2015 has successfully addressed delinquency and lowered the non-performing assets in the banking sector, setting the stage for private corporate investment to take off. The demonetisation drive of 2016 has reduced black money by improving tax compliance.

Besides, the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) rolled out in 2017 has mobilised higher revenues and unified fragmented markets to build economic synergies. The reduction in the corporate tax rate in 2019 to one of the lowest in the world has increased corporate reserves, which are being leveraged to finance higher investments. These reforms have led to a strong churning of the economy, shutting out enterprises that deviated from market principles.

In FY22, the government embarked on a large Capex programme and provided resource support to State governments to increase their Capex budget. From 1.6% of GDP in FY19, the Capex of the central government has risen to 2.7% in FY23 and is budgeted to increase further to 3.3% in FY24 — all this while containing the fiscal deficit to its budgeted ratio to GDP. The idea behind the upscaling of the Capex budget was to not only plug gaps in physical infrastructure but also to “crowd-in” private corporate investment, which was investment-ready, having repaired its balance sheet and progressed to an optimal level of capacity utilisation. Data from Axis Bank, for example, shows private corporate investment rose by 22.4% in FY23, with 15 out of 19 sectors witnessing an expansion in private capital investment.

Along with accelerating economic growth, the government has been focusing on inclusive growth, as reflected in its commitment to Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. It has taken various steps to lift people above the poverty line. Relentless government support towards livelihood enhancement, skill development, women’s empowerment, and infrastructure development has played a vital role in reducing the incidence of poverty in India.

Poverty alleviation, rural welfare

A report by NITI Aayog, that was released recently, showcases a remarkable decline in the prevalence of multidimensional poverty in India; 13.5 crore Indians are estimated to have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21, with rural areas largely driving the decline in the headcount ratio of the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Further, there has been tangible progress in rural living standards, aided by a policy focus on basic amenities. The National Family Health Survey for 2019-21 provides ample evidence of a significant improvement in an array of indicators concerning the quality of rural lives, including access to electricity, improved drinking water sources, and coverage under health insurance schemes. Various health-related indicators, such as institutional births, immunisation and health insurance coverage, have also seen an uptrend.

The government’s support for agriculture has led to fruits, vegetables, the ‘dairy and livestock products combined’, and fishery growing at unprecedented growth rates. Consequently, the share of fruits and vegetables in the food basket has increased to 19.4% in 2021. The percentage of livestock products has come to account for about 38% of the total value of agri-food. The country’s food basket is more nutritious today than ever.

As a country with a large population and a per capita GDP of nearly $2,400, India is aware of the long road ahead to achieve high-income status and a high quality of life for a majority of its citizens. It is a vindication of the success of India’s development record in a democratic polity that the steadily rising aspirations of citizens are being matched by their belief that those aspirations will be realised in their lifetime. Now, if experts realise that it is okay to acknowledge successes as it is to draw attention to shortcomings, the quality of public discourse will catch up with India’s economic progress.

Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) unveiled the decadal vision and strategy for the Indian space economy, on October 10.

IN-SPACe is the single-window, autonomous, nodal agency under the Department of Space. The decadal vision and strategy has been developed by IN-SPACe and ISRO along with other stakeholders.

At present, the Indian space economy is valued at around ₹6,700 crore ($8.4 billion) with a 2% share in the global space economy.

As per IN-SPACe’s projection, India’s space economy has the potential to reach ₹35,200 crore ($44 billion) by 2033 with about 8% of the global share.

At present, the share of the domestic market is ₹6,400 crore ($8.1 billion). The export market share is ₹2,400 crore ($0.3 billion). The aim is to increase the domestic share to ₹26,400 crore ($33 billion), and the export share to ₹88,000 crore ($11 billion).

Besides, an investment of ₹17,600 crore ($22 billion) is envisioned in the next 10 years

The decadal vision addresses creation of demand, local manufacturing capabilities, infrastructure and provides a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework that will encourage and facilitate NGE (non-governmental entities) participation in the growth of the space sector.

Dr. Pawan Goenka, chairman, IN-SPACe said, “As we unveil the decadal vision for Indian space economy, we emphasise that the future of the Indian space sector is a shared endeavour. Hence, our strategy fosters an era of collaboration between all stakeholders to accelerate growth. ISRO is opening its doors wider than ever to private sector participation, so that together, we can successfully boost the space economy for a resurgent Aatmnirbhar Bharat.”

Elaborating on the salient features of the decadal vision and strategy, Dr. Goenka said that the space ecosystem is broadly divided into three groups – Space-for-Earth, Access-to-Space and Space-for-Space.

IN-SPACe aims to achieve the decadal vision and strategy for Indian space economy through 10 key strategic and enabling capabilities, which are

A protracted Israel-Hamas conflict could spur oil prices beyond India’s comfort zone and even if the government holds retail fuel prices ahead of critical elections, wholesale prices may spike and a higher import bill could pressure the rupee, according to experts.

Brent crude oil prices rose over 3% on Monday, crossing $87 a barrel even as equity markets around the world, including India, came under pressure as investors turned risk-averse and rushed to safe haven assets like gold.

Fears of a wider conflict between Israel and Hamas not only pulled down the NSE Nifty 0.72% or 141.2 points to 19,512.4, but also dragged trading volumes on the NSE to “the lowest in many weeks”, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

Broad market indices fell more than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio fell sharply to 0.28:1, he added, stressing that the conflict is the latest negative trigger for markets that are already fretting about macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe and China, hawkish central banks and rising oil prices.

Beyond the short-term effect on markets, Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis said that if the war persists for even a fortnight or more, the oil dynamics will change. Crude oil prices going beyond $90 a barrel would pose trouble for the world economy as well as India.

“Iran joining the fray can affect the sea routes and push up transport and insurance costs. Higher crude prices will distort our balance of trade and current account deficit, thus putting pressure on the rupee,” Mr. Sabnavis noted.

For the government, there could be fiscal implications. With elections looming in several States and for the Lok Sabha in 2024, raising fuel prices may be an unlikely option, but higher costs will have to be absorbed either by oil marketing firms or the exchequer.

“Retail inflation can still be controlled by the government if it chooses to keep fuel prices unchanged. But wholesale price inflation will increase for sure. Some airlines have already increased fares after ATF price hikes, which is also inflationary,” the economist said.

Export earnings could also be hit as Israel buys around $5.5-6 billion of refined petroleum products a year from India."

Taking on critics who argue that India will become the world’s third largest economy in a few years with or without government intervention, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that political stability and policy consistency was essential for the prospect to turn into a reality, especially in a world marred by unprecedented volatility.

Claiming that the government was not keen on taking credit, Ms. Sitharaman said that those treating the Indian economy’s growth from the world’s tenth-largest to the fifth-largest and beyond as a ‘fait accompli’ were not being fair to India’s farmers, entrepreneurs, and the “struggling, weaker economic sections” whose efforts and aspirations have lifted the country.

“From the 10th position in 2013-14, we’ve become the fifth-largest economy, and in the next few years [will] become the third largest... There is no way in which I will accept if anyone says, ‘Oh, it’s guaranteed that we will move from five to three in the next few years and you don’t need a Prime Minister to say I’ll make sure that this country will move to the third rank’. I think that is losing perspective of what it takes to move upwards for better prospects of our citizens,” the Minister said.

Global volatility

Noting that the global environment had faced fewer pressures ten years ago, while today’s situation is marked by complete volatility and disruptions in global supply chains as well as in supplies of food, fuel, and fertilisers, Ms. Sitharaman said: “If that’s the situation, what is guaranteed, pray? And there was a time when India probably was somewhere in 10th position, but it fell back. So going upwards is not a guarantee, but maybe going downwards, high risk.”

Addressing students of the Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi, the Finance Minister said that if any sort of guarantee could be provided, it would stem from political stability and policy consistency. “One government to another or one tenure to another, you have a flip-flop, it affects your economic performance, your macro-economic stability will certainly be hindered. You need political stability, you need continuity, you need decisive political decision-making,” she explained.

Regional differences

“Industry’s concern has always been, ‘Give us stability and policy consistency, otherwise they cannot be economic activity, which can be consistently growing upwards’. You will only be firefighting, if the government policy is continuously being up and down, or seesaw-like unpredictable. If decisiveness is not there, and you’re compromising, because of a coalition in politics or you have other interests, or you are thinking that in this region, if this happens, that region I cannot cater, and therefore making India appear as though some regions are blessed and some others aren’t,” she added.

“I don’t want to name any one region of India, but some regions in this country constantly are trapped with vested interest decision-making. So you need governments which are going to be able to look futuristically, be ready for reforms, be sure that they have to provide consistency for businesses to grow.

The Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.3% in the current financial year aided by investment and domestic demand.

According to a World Bank report released on Tuesday (October 3), India continues to show resilience against the backdrop of a challenging global environment.

In India, which accounts for the bulk of South Asia region, growth is expected to remain robust at 6.3% in 2023-24, India Development Update of the World Bank said.

On inflation, the report said, it is expected to decrease gradually as food prices normalise and government measures help increase the supply of key commodities."

Airbnb, a U.S.-based online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experience, contributed more than $920 million to India’s Gross Domestic Product and supported in the creation of more than 85,000 jobs in 2022 alone, according to Oxford Economics, a global economic forecasting and econometric analysis outfit.

The company’s contribution in terms of revenue and jobs has more than doubled since 2019 despite the outbreak of COVID-19 and international border restrictions, it added.

In 2022, Airbnb guests spent a total of $815 million on transportation, restaurants, retail stores, and retail stores in the country, as per the study.

Goa has seen Airbnb’s highest presence, where its guests spent $190 million, this was followed by Bengaluru and Delhi, Mumbai and Manali.

The story so far: The current strain in diplomatic relations between Canada and India has raised concerns about the impact spiralling onto commercial and economic spheres of cooperation. Negotiations towards the Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), which was to serve as an early transitional step towards the larger Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) now stand “paused.” This was widely expected to be sealed in a trade mission that was expected to arrive in India this October — now cancelled. Further concerns relate to the longer-term impact on the larger commercial and economic sphere should relations further deteriorate.

How significant is the trade relationship between the two countries?

As per the Ministry of Commerce’s TradeStat database, in FY 2022-23, Canada was India’s 35th largest trading partner overall.

Further, as put forth in an earlier joint statement following the sixth Ministerial Dialogue on Trade & Investment (MDTI) in Ottawa in May, Canada-India bilateral trade in goods reached C$12 billion in 2022, growing 57% on a year-over-year basis; of this, the bilateral services trade contributed C8.9 billion to the overall figure.

According to Mohit Singla, Chairman at the Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) the trade between the countries is “pretty balanced.” He elaborates that Canada is ranked 14th in imports globally (with a share of 2.3%), but is 32nd in India’s export markets, with a share of 0.9%, currently exhibiting “low potential.” Having said that, he adds that the past two years have seen a sudden upsurge in exports from India at a CAGR of 32%. Other than mineral fuels, categories that have shown strong CAGR in this period include iron and steel, electrical machinery, rubber, nuclear reactors, apparel, pearls, and furniture and plastics, Mr. Singla says.

“This shows a strong surge in confidence by Canadian companies when it comes to sourcing from India across a wide range of categories. Clearly, the momentum has been building as compared to the pre-2020 period, when the overall export CAGR (2013-20) from India to Canada was just around 4%,” said Mr Singla.

From the Canadian perspective, India is a “priority market.” It was the North American country’s 10th largest trading partner. Global Canada (the international diplomacy and affairs department) has also said that “India will be a key partner as Canada strengthens its economic links to the Indo-Pacific under a new, comprehensive strategy for the region.”

How will this impact trade relations?

India imported merchandise worth approximately U.S.$4.05 billion in FY 2022-23 from Canada and exported about U.S.$4.11 billion worth of goods — indicating a largely balanced trade. India’s primary export items include coal, coke and briquettes, fertilisers, iron and steel, and lentils. On the other hand, India’s major items of export are pharmaceutical products, iron and steel products, organic chemicals and marine products, along with apparel and textiles of varied forms and variants.

The CEPA, which now stands “paused,” was to further take care of “trade in goods, trade in services, rules of origin, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade and other areas of economic cooperation”.

Mr Singla notes that, from available data, “Equivalent ad valorem tariff for India is high on dairy products, cereals, meat, fish, cocoa, apparel, textiles etc., which would undoubtedly be areas of interest for exporters,” adding that “to that extent, the FTA negotiations would delay possible easing of trade barriers in these sectors.”

On the other hand, as Mr Singla observes, “most of India’s top exports face minimal tariff barriers, with the exception of cereals and apparels, so a delay may not have a substantiative impact on India’s exports to Canada.”

What about the investment ecosystem?

As per the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency’s Invest India, Canada is the 18th largest foreign investor in India..

Several Canadian companies have established their presence in India; this is besides the country’s more important pension funds such as the Canadian Pension Fund (or CPP). As reported by news agency Reuters, CPP increased its investment in the Indian markets to about $15 billion in areas such as real estate, renewables and the financial sector at the end of the previous financial year.

Other big pension funds with sizeable exposure to India include Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) — which has investments of about C$8 billion and the Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan (OTPP) with $3 billion — both until the end of last year. Observers in Canada believe that in the immediate term, their positions might not be at risk. They argue that the tensions could however cause operational inconveniences, as travel may be an issue.

What about education in Canada?

As per official statistics, Canada has about 1.08 lakh students from India at present. This accounts for more than 37% of its overall international student pool. Canada- based publication The Global and Mailwrote that the international student tuition (fee) is “several times higher than for Canadian students,” adding that it “has become essential to the finances of many postsecondary schools.” Any strain in the relationship between the two countries would not bode well for them.

In an advisory on September 23, the Ministry of External Affairs in India urged Indian nationals and students in Canada to “exercise utmost caution.”

Jeff Nankivell, President and CEO at the think-tank Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada told BNN Bloomberg that the “single greatest economic relationship between the two countries is the inflow of students from India... and if that is diminished, it would have negative implications not just for educational institutions but also for Canadian communities that are hosts to Indian international students.”"

Union Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan on September 22 said that artificial intelligence (AI) can replace work that is being done by accountants and auditors. Talking about the increasing influence of AI, he said, “This has a specific implication for the economy, which is, automation of business processes can be much more potent with Artificial Intelligence than it was without AI. This can potentially replace quite a bit of the work that is being done today by accountants and auditors.”

Delivering the CA S. Hariharan Memorial Lecture that was organised by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, here in Chennai, the Finance Secretary said, “Another economic trend that I foresee is the expansion of credit [lending] in the Indian economy.”

He explained, “In India credit to the private sector is approximately 55% of the GDP. In China it is above 180%. I would not say the Chinese level is healthy or desirable... it is not. That is not a goal we should see. However, one can argue that India’s level is too low. It has to rise to 100-120% of GDP which will accelerate investment and growth,” he added. “Projects which would otherwise not start will start if they get enough credit. But the challenge is to expand the volume of credit without bad debts and what we politely call as NPA’s. This expansion of credit will expand demand for accountants,” he pointed out.

Mr. Somanathan also highlighted that India’s population growth is now tapering off. “What is not very well know is that there are fewer children in schools than ten years ago. Certain level of population are declining. The stage is coming where some schools will have to be closed. But as India becomes richer the number of income tax payers will increase continuously for many years to come at at least the rate of GDP growth. I foresee an annual expansion of 6-7% in the number of Income tax payers and this will increase demand for good accountants,” he said."

Better eye health can economically boost the Indian economy by $27 billion every year, according to a global study by International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and Prof. Kevin Frick from Johns Hopkins University.

(For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters)

The study calculated the economic value of avoidable sight loss (blindness due to refractive error and unoperated cataract) among people in the 50 to 65 age bracket across the globe. While vision impaired people in this age category incurred economic losses to the tune of $27 billion per annum in India, their counterparts in China lost the highest at $96 billion while the loss in the U.S is estimated at $50 billion, implied the study by the IAPB, a London-based global alliance of organisations working towards the elimination of avoidable blindness and vision impairment.

India has the third highest potential savings from avoiding sight loss through better eye health, as per the study which was released globally on October 12, the World Sight Day.

Sight loss affects 70 million people in India and over 1.1 billion individuals worldwide. For these individuals, an estimated 30% also experience a reduction in employment — but 90% of this sight loss can be avoided with early intervention and treatment, protecting their future earnings and transforming their lives, according to the survey.

The research drew on Gross National Income per capita data from the World Bank and eye health data from IAPB Vision Atlas, collated by an international group of ophthalmologists and optometrists.

Peter Holland, CEO, IAPB and spokesperson of IAPB’s campaign, Love Your Eyes, said, “Our eyes are central to our ability to earn a living. Sight loss has a profound impact on one’s personal and professional life. Women, people in rural communities and ethnic minority groups are even more likely to experience sight loss and be excluded from employment and services.’‘"

There has been intense focus on India’s growth performance of late. First, on the occasion of the Delhi meetings of the G-20, the government announced that it was the world’s fastest growing major economy. It was met with a challenge from an independent economist on the grounds that the government had relied on the income method to estimate GDP, and that were the expenditure method to be used instead the observed growth rate would be lower. The Finance Ministry responded that the Government of India had been consistent in using GDP estimated by the income method throughout.

This is correct.

A focus that is flawed

However, it may be noted that the contestation had been over economic performance in a single quarter, namely the first quarter of the current financial year. Soon after this exchange, Arvind Subramanian and Josh Felman investigated whether India’s growth rate is accelerating or decelerating after the COVID-19 year of 2020-21. They concluded (in a media article, September 14) that “after a strong recovery there has been a significant ebbing of dynamism over the last three quarters”. The former Chief Economic Adviser and his co-author may well be right, but both the government and those challenging its narrative are focused on very short phases of growth. This can result in mistaking the cycle — a temporary fluctuation — for the trend, which is the long-term tendency.

Statistical considerations apart, right now there are good reasons for looking at a slice of time longer than a few quarters when studying economic growth in India. We are edging towards the general election 2024. A major issue in this election would be the impact the incumbent party has had in managing the economy. Though only one aspect of economic performance, the growth of GDP, has become the main focus of attention. This shift in focus has been led by the Narendra Modi government itself. So, it should be open to an evaluation of its performance based on this indicator.

Growth, from 1950 to the present

To ascertain the impact on the economy of the present government, we investigate whether it has been able to raise its underlying rate of growth, termed the ‘trend’. As part of this, we study GDP growth from 1950 to the present. This enables us to see recent growth in relation to what has been achieved in the past. Also, we adopt a statistical procedure that identifies changes in the underlying rate of growth. And, what do we find?

Studying growth up to the year 2019-20, which is the pre-COVID year, we find that the last time the growth rate increased in India was in 2000. The conclusion from this must be that the Modi government has not had success in raising the rate of growth of India’s economy while in office. This does not mean that the promised “Achhe Din” have not come, for there has been growth of income per capita, but this government has not been able to quicken the pace at which they have been coming our way for decades.

The finding does not surprise, for in the six years up to the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth rate had slowed sequentially in three, immediately upon the demonetisation of 2016. As no major exogenous shock struck the economy in this period, it must be concluded that it is the demonetisation that caused the slowing.

The reason for terminating our study at 2019-20 was that the COVID-19 epidemic, which broke soon after, was a shock that was external to the economy, caused by natural factors. We want to exclude from our analysis any impact on GDP that was not under the control of the government.

But what of the recovery since, for which the government takes credit? There is a way of assessing this claim. We may forecast GDP in the years after COVID-19 by projecting forward the growth rate achieved prior to 2019-20, and see how actual outcomes compare to these projections.

So, we forecast the GDP in 2022-23 by extending the average annual growth rate of 6.5% achieved for the period 2000-01 to 2019-20. We found that actual GDP in 2022-23 is 11.1% less than predicted. So, the recovery from the pandemic may well have been ‘V-shaped’ but till last year, GDP was yet below trend, so to speak.

The COVID-19 year

Finally, though focusing on GDP growth after the pandemic may show the Indian economy in a relatively good light compared to other major economies, it misses a crucial aspect of economic management during the present government’s term in office. This is how the economy performed during the COVID year of 2020-21. In that year, most BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the United States contracted less than India did. All these countries had also adopted a stronger macroeconomic stimulus. The stimulus adopted by the Government of India then was astonishingly small.

The contraction of GDP during the pandemic in India is most related to that dogmatic refusal to stimulate the economy when needed. It accounts for the corresponding recovery that followed in 2021-22. In effect, very high growth that year reflects the re-starting of production after the lifting of a very stringent lockdown, rather than an independent economic response to smart policy, which is how it is presented. Having left the economy to shift for itself for much of its tenure recently, Modinomics has swivelled to addressing growth frontally. Perhaps having realised that it has not had much success in stimulating private investment, the government has, over the last two Budgets, hiked capital spending at historically high rates. The ideal of ‘minimum government’ seems to have been shelved in election season.

Moody's on August 18 affirmed India's sovereign rating at 'Baa3' with a stable outlook and said high growth will support a gradual increase in income levels, which will further contribute to economic strength.

Moody's said it expects India's economic growth to outpace all other G20 economies through at least the next two years, driven by domestic demand.

""Moody's Investors Service has today affirmed the Government of India's long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating atBaa3. Moody's has also affirmed India's other short-term local-currency rating at P-3. The outlook remains stable,"" it said in a statement.

Baa3 is the lowest investment grade rating.

All three global rating agencies, Fitch, S&P and Moody’s, have the lowest investment grade rating on India, with a stable outlook. The ratings are looked at by investors as a barometer of a country’s creditworthiness and affect borrowing costs.

It said although potential growth has come down in the past 7-10 years, the Indian economy is likely to continue to grow rapidly by international standards.

""High GDP growth will contribute to gradually rising income levels and overall economic resilience. In turn, this will support gradual fiscal consolidation and government debt stabilization, albeit at high levels. In addition, the financial sector continues to strengthen, alleviating much of the economic and contingent liability risks that had previously driven downward rating pressure,"" Moody's said."

India’s digital economy has been seeing accelerated growth and is expected to account for 20% of the country’s GDP by 2026, said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, on Thursday.

“Our digital economy was 4.5% of the GDP in 2014 and it is 11% today. And we expect the digital economy to contribute over 20% of our GDP by 2026,” the Minister said while delivering the inaugural address at G20 Digital Innovation Alliance Summit in Bengaluru on Thursday.

India’s tech adoption was mostly driven by its growing need for real solutions that could address various issues in order to transform people’s lives, to transform governance, and to transform democracy.

“We want to see every citizen and every consumer have access to digital products and services, be it Instagram reels or digital public infrastructure that connect them to the government and governance. Or accessing other facets of digitalistion such as cloud and all of its upstream and downstream impacts,” he added.

According to the Minister, “the centre of gravity of tech”, which used to be controlled by a few countries centred around a few corporations, is moving to open source systems and to younger start-ups that are disrupting the normal. “These trends in turn are broadening digitisation in the country,” he noted.

Digital public infrastructure, security in the digital economy, and digital skilling are going to be the key topics expected to be discussed in the digital innovation edition of the G20 summit. Delegates from various member countries representing ed-tech, health-tech, agri-tech, fin-tech, secured digital infrastructure, and circular economy are participating in the three-day summit."

The National Statistical Office (NSO) has released the 2022-23 GDP fourth-quarter growth rate figures. Measured against fourth-quarter figures of the previous year, the data give a gloomier picture than what the media publications of the Press Information Bureau present. According to NSO data, in the first COVID-19 pandemic quarter of 2020-21, i.e., April 1 to June 30, 2020, GDP growth rate was minus 23.8% when compared to GDP of the same period in 2019-20.

Three conclusions based on NSO data since 2014-2015 are important for a reality check. First, the growth rate of GDP, since 2015-16 had been declining annually, and has fallen in the fourth quarter to what it was earlier, and sneeringly referred to by economists as “The Hindu Rate of Growth” — 3.5% growth rate in GDP.

Second, it is essential to recognise that since 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s widely publicised “Vikas” in reality achieved the so-called “Hindu rate of growth” in GDP of what had been achieved in the period 1950-77 — the socialism period.

Third, during the tenures of P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh, GDP growth rates rose for the first time to between 6% to 8% per year over a 15-year period, i.e., 1991-96 and 2004-2014 (with the usual cyclic ups and downs).

That is, it took Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh as Prime Ministers to understand and reform the Indian economic system, to reduce state participation and increase incentives for capital and labour providers, thus achieving a higher and faster growth of the economy.

What is alarming today is the serious and continuous decline in GDP growth rates which began in 2016. And that decline continues even now. The Modi government has failed to structure economic policy coherently and which has prevailed during the period 2014-2023.

Editorial | Risky recourse: On the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee and policy rate

The growth rate of GDP has been consistently in decline since 2016. There are also the brazen announcements of rosy predictions being published annually in the media, with outrageous claims made by the Prime Minister such as $5 trillion GDP by 2024 (announced in 2019), implying an annual doubling of GDP in five years, or, in other words, a 15% annual growth rate of GDP. No policy structuring has been presented.

Steps to be taken

By “structuring”, this writer means a clear implementation of what the economic objectives will be, and priorities that should be assigned to the various objectives. Thereafter, there ought to be a strategy on what should be incentivised and what should be deleted or discontinued. For example, in today’s dark economic condition, it is essential that personal income tax is abolished and Goods and Services Tax scrapped to incentivise investors and earners.

Resources by the government should be mobilised through indirect taxes and also by liberal printing of currency notes and which is circulated by paying wages to the employment generated in extensive public works. The annual interest paid on fixed-term savings in bank accounts should be 9% or so to increase purchasing power of the middle classes. Interest rates on loans to small and medium industries should be no more than 6% of the loans to increase production of these sectors, and thus employment.

This writer is prepared to have a public debate with any government official and prove that “Modinomics” is an unstructured and gigantic flop. No macroeconomic goal that has been announced has been reached to date.

India needs a new economic policy urgently. It needs to be a policy that is based on clear objectives, priorities, have a strategy to achieve targets, and spell out an intelligent and transparent resource mobilisation plan to finance policies. As far as the Finance Ministry is concerned, we have only incoherent public announcements — a hotchpotch — with no accountability.

The market system is not a free-for-all or an ad hoc measure. It has a structure with rules for transactions. Market system capitalism works as the principal drivers are incentive and capital (whose use for innovation raises factory productivity and the growth rate of GDP). Even a totalitarian state such as China understood this. During the tenure of Deng Xiaoping as the supremo, it allowed the socialist economic system to die and an economic market-based system came in.

Deregulations should also not mean that we reject government intervention for safety nets, affirmative action, market failure and creating a level-playing field. Democratic institutions have to be empowered to guard against public disorder arising from rapid de-regulation — as it happened in Russia post-1991. Russia experienced chaos and misery. This dictatorship has returned for the Russians, and with it a complete loss of human rights and democratic values.

The trade-off between the public sector and de-regulation and the sale of loss-making units, increasing employment, through affirmative action, and easy access to social security and a safety net are essential to create a stake for the poor in the system. This creates a level-playing field in a competitive system, ensures transparency, accountability, and trusteeship (philanthropy), as well as corporate governance to legitimise profit-making smoothly which drives the market system. Such steps reduce monopolistic tendencies and help in the formation of a democratic and harmonious society.

According to the report, global growth is projected to fall from an estimated 3.5% in 2022 to 3% in both 2023 and 2024.

While the forecast for 2023 is modestly higher than predicted in the April 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO), it remains weak by historical standards.

The rise in central bank policy rates to fight inflation continues to weigh on economic activity. Global headline inflation is expected to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023 and 5.2% in 2024, it said.

Underlying (core) inflation is projected to decline more gradually, and forecasts for inflation in 2024 have been revised upward, it said.

The IMF said the recent resolution of the U.S. debt ceiling standoff and, earlier this year, strong action by authorities to contain turbulence in the U.S. and Swiss banking, reduced the immediate risks of financial sector turmoil.

This moderated adverse risks to the outlook, it said.

However, the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside.

Inflation could remain high and even rise if further shocks occur, including those from an intensification of the war in Ukraine and extreme weather-related events, triggering more restrictive monetary policy, the report said.

Financial sector turbulence could resume as markets adjust to further policy tightening by central banks. China’s recovery could slow, in part as a result of unresolved real estate problems, with negative cross-border spillovers, it said.

“Sovereign debt distress could spread to a wider group of economies. On the upside, inflation could fall faster than expected, reducing the need for tight monetary policy, and domestic demand could again prove more resilient,” said the WEO report.

The IMF said central banks in economies with elevated and persistent core inflation should continue to clearly signal their commitment to reducing inflation.

A restrictive stance — with real rates above neutral — is needed until there are clear signs that underlying inflation is cooling.

“With fiscal deficits and government debt above pre-pandemic levels, credible medium-term fiscal consolidation is in many cases needed to restore budgetary room for manoeuvre and ensure debt sustainability,” the IMF said."

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday, July 19, 2023, retained India's economic growth forecast at 6.4 per cent for the current financial year and 6.7 per cent for the next, saying robust domestic demand will continue to support the region's recovery.

In an update to its Asian Development Outlook, the ADB said inflation is expected to continue to fall, approaching pre-pandemic levels as fuel and food prices decline. It forecast 3.6 per cent inflation this year for developing economies in Asia, and 3.4 per cent in 2024.

The Indian economy grew 7.2 per cent in the 2022-23 fiscal ended March 2023.

""Asia and the Pacific continues to recover from the pandemic at a steady pace,"" ADB Chief Economist Albert Park said.

""Domestic demand and services activity are driving growth, while many economies are also benefiting from a strong recovery in tourism. However, industrial activity and exports remain weak, and the outlook for global growth and demand next year has worsened, Mr. Park added.

In April, the ADB had projected that India's economic growth is expected to moderate to 6.4 per cent in the current financial year due to tight monetary conditions and elevated oil prices."

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
133,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
173,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
183,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
193,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
203,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
213,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
223,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
283,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence.

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
293,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
303,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
373,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
383,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
393,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
413,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
453,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
463,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
473,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
483,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?

Little did we know that beyond the automated factory machines, self-driving cars, and robocops, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would one day crash into our lives, authoring poems, tipping us with pickup lines, and passing the toughest examinations. The recent rise of Large Language Models and Generative AI has sparked more interest in the progress of AI across the globe. ChatGPT was running with its servers crammed for months, and Twitter feeds were filled with quirky ChatGPT quotes followed by threads shedding light on the versatile application of such chatbots. Ethical debates on the use of generative AI have subsided in the realisation that users will have a ‘productivity-powered’ upper hand over a non-user. The subjects of worker replacements and economic growth with the rise of AI have entered the spiral that the Internet once went through.

Positive effects of AI adoption

There is broad consensus on increasing productivity by adopting AI in producing goods and services. In a study called “Generative AI at Work” (involving over 5,000 customer support agents in the Philippines), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists showed that AI tools boosted worker productivity by 14% and improved consumer satisfaction, leading to better treatment of customer service agents and increased employee retention. Experts suggest that generative AI may not replace employees, but employees using generative AI will replace those who do not upskill.

A recent survey among employees of LinkedIn’s top 50 companies in the United States shows that almost 70% of them found AI helping them to be faster, smarter, and more productive. Another 32% were of the opinion that while AI’s current impact may be modest, they anticipate larger gains over the next five years. Professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the MIT suggests that restructuring business processes and increased investments are essential to fully leverage AI’s productivity potential.

Research from across the world is also largely optimistic about AI’s impacts on growth. A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicted an increase in global GDP by 14% or $15.7 trillion by 2030 due to ongoing technological advancements in AI. Further, a report from Goldman Sachs Research in April 2023 said that generative AI alone could raise global GDP by 7% or almost $7 trillion over a 10-year period. The report highlights generative AI’s potential to create human-like output and that its ability to break down communication barriers between humans and machines could have large positive macroeconomic effects.

The Forum for the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets surveyed and published the views of U.S. and European economic experts on the impact of AI on the per capita income of the U.S. and western Europe. On the question whether AI will result in a substantial increase in the growth rates of real capita income in the U.S. and western Europe over the next two decades, 44% of the U.S. experts agreed to an expected substantial increase, whereas 46% said the effects were uncertain. Among the European experts, 34% expected a substantial increase in GDP per capita, while 42% were uncertain about the effects of AI. Only 2% of experts believed that AI would not significantly impact per capita GDP; this included Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford, who pointed out historical data on slowed GDP growth despite technological advancements. On another question of whether a ban on generative AI chatbots could negatively impact national innovation, 62% of the European experts agreed that a ban could hinder innovation, 14% were uncertain, and only 2% disagreed.

Employment may be adversely affected

Experts also point to multiple negative impacts of AI technologies. The first is labour replacement that AI technologies bring to the table. AI can automate repetitive tasks and with generative AI, even creative tasks can be done efficiently and fast. A research paper titled “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets” by Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University found that robot adoption has a negative effect on workers, on average — it reduces the labour share, employment and wages. These adverse effects primarily affect blue-collar workers and individuals with lower levels of education.

In “Tasks, Automation, and the Rise in U.S. Wage Inequality”, the two authors document that between 50% and 70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure over the last four decades can be attributed to relative wage declines of worker groups specialised in routine tasks in industries experiencing rapid automation. Acemoglu argues that automation reduces labour share and wages, especially when productivity gains from automation are small. His other studies also highlight distributional concerns over automation, causing inequality among workers and possible serious negative impacts on social welfare. A European Parliamentary Research Service report cites McKinsey Global Institute’s research that suggests that AI may intensify competition and deepen the technological divide among firms. Early adopters of AI may gain significant advantages, leading to a winner-takes-all scenario.

The Guardian puts forward the idea that AI could be highly disruptive as it is more likely to displace middle-class, white-collared jobs; in comparison, earlier technological advancements displaced people from lower-paid farm jobs to higher-paid factory floor jobs. Analysis by Goldman Sachs has suggested that 15%-35% of work in the U.S. economy is exposed to automation. Still, the finance giant also puts out numbers to show how this may not adversely affect the labour market — “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions” — hinting at the possibility of AI creating more jobs than on how much it displaces. But surely, no inferences can be yet derived on how each upgrade impacts the labour market.

Opportunities for India

India, being the most populous country, should be on the lookout as any net negative effect on employment can adversely impact the economy. Increased efficiency by the adoption of AI in call centres and software industries does not bode well for millions of Indians who work in the field. Regulation on the use of AI is not a bright solution as this would just drive investments and new opportunities away. The PwC report suggests that the greatest economic gains from AI will come from China, with a projected 26% boost to GDP by 2030. Thus, it would be prudent for India to focus more on education and training in AI; this could be a lot easier now with online education having larger acceptance after the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the demographic dividend and new opportunities that emanate from AI.

Editorial |Good and bad: On India and artificial intelligence

AI has seeped into every aspect of the global economy, and its effect on productivity and growth is being seen in an optimistic way. Views on the effect of AI on the labour market and its impact on society are gloomy, with 70% of American experts in an IGM survey agreeing that AI could create deep challenges for society, including in the labour market, politics, data privacy, crime and warfare; these challenges are difficult to anticipate and plan for. Governments would have to step up their cyber regulations with respect to the new challenges posed by AI and may also need tax capital, as suggested by many experts, to balance the returns from capital and labour to reduce the displacement and distributional effects. Either way, ever-growing advancements in AI are now a reality and equipping ourselves with the latest tools will help us forge ahead along with everyone else.

And no, an apocalypse where robots take over the human world is nowhere soon.

In a veiled attack on China, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said that, unlike some other countries, India is not ""an extractive economy"" and it was not pursuing ""narrow economic activities"" in the resource-rich African continent.

Mr. Jaishankar, who arrived here on Thursday after visiting Zanzibar, made these remarks while addressing the Indian community in Dar-es-Salaam city of Tanzania.

""Had a lively interaction with members of the Indian community in Dar es Salaam. Stressed the importance of Mission IT (India & Tanzania). Highlighted the strong India-Africa connection, especially our deep links with East Africa; Heart of India and Tanzania ties is the solidarity of spirit and mutuality of interests,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. ""Recognised that the Indian community is an expression, contributor and force of this relationship; Explained how India and Tanzania's friendship is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian. Our water projects will benefit 8 million; With 750 slots annually,"" he tweeted.

Tanzania is India’s largest African partner in training and capacity building. ""The Indian community had historically been a source of strength for the relationship. As our ties expand, so will their role,"" he tweeted.

While addressing the community, he said, ""Today we want to see Africa grow. We want to see African economies grow. And our approach to Africa today is to trade more with Africa, invest in Africa, work with Africa, to create capacities in Africa, so that the rise of Africa also takes place as countries like India are rising in Asia.""

""We are not here as an extractive economy. We are not here in the manner in which a lot of other countries are there for very narrow economic objectives. For us, this is a broader, deeper partnership,"" Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to China's forays, including those of its military, into Africa.

China established its first overseas military support base in Djibouti in Africa in 2015, as part of Beijing's plan to project its military power beyond the Asia-Pacific. Chinese companies are also actively engaged in exploiting the region's precious mineral resources.

Mr. Jaishankar also added that today the ""world sees India as a contributor. World sees India, Indian companies, Indian technologies, Indian capacities as helping to create better lives for them"".

He also said that he is here in Tanzania on an 'IT mission' which is an India-Tanzania mission. The mission addresses some of the most important priorities of this country.

On trade, Jaishankar said that ""Our trade with Africa is $95 billion... I can predict very confidently that.. will grow very rapidly in the community and they will grow rapidly in the coming decade for three reasons. One, the Indian economy, Indian businesses are going up more and more.""

""That's one reason for demand in Africa. Now, it is up to us to meet that Africa will have a demand. We have to compete, you know, maybe they'll go to China, Europe or Turkey. But if Indian business is more and more competitive if people are willing to go out more and more, I think a large part of the demand will be met,"" he said.

""Third is technology. Technology is driven in different ways. Automobiles could be healthy. It could be digital, I think that is what India can make. So politically, it's so easy for us really to bond with African governments and believers."" He also stressed that the Indian diaspora is a very unique bridge between India and Africa.

""...For us, the bridge that the Indian diaspora represents is something it's a very unique bridge. Very few countries have such a bridge..."" He also added that with 750 slots annually, Tanzania is India's largest African partner in training and capacity building.

""As I look across Africa, the largest capacity building and exchange programme we have with any country in Africa is actually with Tanzania,"" he said, adding, ""This year, we are giving to the Tanzanian government for their usage, 450 scholarships under Itech programme. This is our traditional exchange programme, 240 slots for defence training, and under the education exchanges, 70 scholarships,"" he said.

He also asked members of the Indian community living in Tanzania, working in Tanzania or visiting Tanzania, to be proud as the friendship between the two countries is making a difference in the lives of the average Tanzanian.

""We would actually be bringing drinking water to 8 million people. So for all of you as members of the Indian community living in Tanzania working in Tanzania, visiting Tanzania, I think you can hold your head high that our friendship, our relationship, our partnership today will make a difference,"" he added.

""I went to a place called Kidutani in Zanzibar, where there is a water project. And this water project, when...it is completed, will provide drinking water to eight million people,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Minister attended a deck reception hosted onboard INS Trishul with Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Tanzania also witnessed the signing of the agreement on setting up of IIT Madras Zanzibar campus.

During the event, Mr. Jaishankar said that it was a great privilege to share with Zanzibar India's experiences in the field of water development. ""It's been a very big challenge for us.""

""Today, one of our key development programmes has been the 'Jal Jeevan mission'... it's a massive pan-Indian project and for us what we are doing with you is a natural extrapolation of what we are doing in India, and we are very privileged to partner with you in that,"" Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar also visited Stone Town in Zanzibar and experienced its distinctive Gujarat connection. ""Blessed to visit the Arya Samaj and Shri Shiv Shakti mandirs there. This time-tested confluence of Africa and India is emerging as a statement of our contemporary partnership,"" he tweeted."

“Stellar macroeconomic management in the midst of unprecedented global challenges has put India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations,” the Finance Ministry said in a report on July 6.

“Investments in supply-side infrastructure have raised the possibility of India enjoying sustained economic growth longer than it has been able to do in several decades,” Monthly Economic Review for May and Annual Review of 2023 said.

Also read: Editorial | Miles to go: On the state of the Indian economy

“India appears poised to sustain its growth in a more durable way than before,” the report said, “nonetheless, it is no time to rest on the laurels nor risk diluting the painstakingly and consciously achieved economic stability. If we are patient, the rising tide will lift all boats as it has begun to.”

The report said that despite unprecedented global challenges in the last few years coming on top of balance sheet troubles in Indian banking and non-financial corporate sectors, “macroeconomic management has been stellar. It contributed significantly to enhancing India’s macroeconomic stability and set India on a quicker recovery path than has been the case in other nations.”

Observing that a critical cog in the wheel of economic growth in FY23 was the disciplined fiscal stance of the Central government, the report said, the year ended with a lower fiscal deficit (as per cent of GDP) compared to the previous year.

“Yet, the government could cut duties and increase welfare spending to alleviate stress from inflation,” it said, adding, the government could also maintain its enhanced provision for capital expenditure, which is now leading to the crowding-in of private investment.

The report highlighted that the Indian economy has carried the momentum from FY23 into the current fiscal year and high frequency indicators paint a healthy picture of the state of the economy.

Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions, it said, adding, rural demand is also on its path to recovery, with robust growth in two- and three-wheelers sales.

“Goods and Services tax collection, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sector continues to expand,” it said.

On the global front, it said, the uptick in economic activity during the first quarter of 2023 has also continued in the second quarter, as evident in the expansion of the global Composite PMI.

""However, factors that can constrain the pace of growth include escalation of geopolitical stress, enhanced volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, a high magnitude of El-Nino impact and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand.

""Should these developments deepen and dampen growth in the subsequent quarters, the external sector may challenge India's growth outlook for FY24,"" it said.

Talking about the more-than-expected GDP estimate for 2022-23, the report said a strong final quarter performance pushed the GDP growth for the full year to 7.2%, higher than the 7% estimated in February.

“The country’s impressive growth experience in FY23, when the world economy was rocked by inflation and restrained by monetary tightening, is a narrative on what works or does not work for the Indian economy,” it said, adding, what clearly works for India’s economy is the strength of its domestic demand.

“The pandemic had struck at its roots to cause an unprecedented contraction of output in FY21, but domestic demand has recovered since then and moved from strength to strength in FY23,” it said."
503,The Hindu,Indian economy has moved away from twin-balance sheet problem ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indian-economy-has-moved-away-from-twin-balance-sheet-problem-banks-now-profitable-fm/article67030381.ece,,"July 01, 2023 01:45 pm | Updated 04:00 pm IST - New Delhi

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on July 1 that the Indian economy has moved away from the twin-balance sheet problem of banks and corporates to twin-balance sheet advantage because of the concerted efforts of the Modi Government.

Profit of public sector banks increased to ₹1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, tripling from what it was in 2014, the Minister said while inaugurating the corporate office of Punjab & Sind Bank in New Delhi.

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to deterioration in financial health of banks and corporates at the same time.

""As a result [of various initiatives of the government] I'm glad to say the problems of twin-balance sheets have gone away like the Reserve Bank observing it is a twin-balance sheet advantage that the Indian economy is benefiting from,"" Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Minister said the term twin-balance sheet was heard after a long time and according to the Reserve Bank, the Indian economy is now benefiting from the twin-balance sheet advantage.

She said that the performance of the public sector banks has improved on account of various initiatives taken by the Modi government since 2014.

There was an improvement in all critical parameters like return on asset, net interest margin and provisioning coverage ratio, she added.

The 4R strategy followed by the Modi government to revitalise the state-owned banks has yielded results, she said.

The 4R strategy refers to recognising the problem of non-performing assets, recapitalising the banks, resolving their problems, and reforming them.

Ms. Sitharaman further said the banks should endeavour to adopt a proactive approach in reaching out to people to achieve optimum utilisation of financial inclusion schemes.

There should be a focus on credit outreach in states where the credit offtake is lower than the national average, particularly in the northeast and eastern parts of the country, she said, adding they must aim to increase brick-and-mortar banking presence in border areas, particularly in the those covered in the Vibrant Village Programme.

The minister also recalled the story of the Punjab and Sind Bank, which had suffered due to partition in 1947. Only two of the ten branches remained in India, while the rest went to Pakistan.

Starting from just two branches in 1947, the Punjab and Sind Bank has 1,553 branches, and the 1,554th at Karimganj in Assam was inaugurated remotely by the minister on Saturday."

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on June 28 said that the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds.

He said that financial stability is non-negotiable and all stakeholders in the financial system must work to preserve this at all times.

""The Reserve Bank and the other financial regulators remain steadfast in their commitment to safeguard financial stability in the face of potential and emerging challenges,"" he said in a foreword to Financial Stability Report (FSR).

In this fragile global milieu, he said, balancing the policy trade-offs, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability, shoring up confidence and supporting sustainable growth are top priorities for policymakers the world over.

Over the last three years, the global economy has been navigating successive high-amplitude shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic waves; protracted geopolitical hostilities; rapid monetary policy tightening; and the recent banking turmoil.

Economic fragmentation is threatening macroeconomic prospects, especially among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), he said.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories.

The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

Earlier this year, U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It was followed by the bailout of UBS, the Switzerland's largest bank, by Credit Suisse in March.

Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories, it said, adding, the global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.

In contrast, it said, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers.

Both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth, he said, adding, the reach and depth of financial intermediation are being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

As the recent banking turmoil in certain advanced economies (AEs) suggests, new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, he said.

While international cooperation among regulators on these issues is of paramount importance, he said, so far as India is concerned, both regulators and regulated entities need to stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a stable financial system.

It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked, he said.

International cooperation and regulatory focus are also needed to tackle other challenges such as cyber risks and climate change, he said.

Through its G20 presidency, India is striving to improve the efficacy of multilateralism in several such areas. These efforts are fittingly captured in India’s theme for G20: One Earth, One Family, One Future."

Despite the global economy facing heightened uncertainty due to banking system fragility in certain countries, persisting geopolitical tensions and moderating but elevated inflation, the Indian economy and the domestic financial system remain resilient supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in the 27th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) which was released on Wednesday.

As per the FSR continuing growth momentum, moderating inflation, narrowing current account deficit, rising foreign exchange reserves, ongoing fiscal consolidation and a robust financial system are setting the economy on a path of sustained growth.

Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates are engendering a new credit and investment cycle and brightening the prospects of the Indian economy, the RBI said in the report.

The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose to historical highs of 17.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in March 2023, it added.

Scheduled Commercial Banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued its downtrend and fell to a 10-year low of 3.9% in March 2023 and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio declined to 1%, it further said.

“Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The system-level capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) in March 2024, under baseline, medium and severe stress scenarios, is projected at 16.1%, 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively,” the central bank said in the FSR.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his foreword to the FSR said despite heightened uncertainties and formidable headwinds in the past three years, the Indian economy has made a solid recovery and is among the fastest-growing large economies.

“Since the last issue of the FSR in December 2022, the global and Indian financial systems have charted somewhat different trajectories,” he said.

“The global financial system has been impacted by significant strains since early March 2023 from the banking turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, the financial sector in India has been stable and resilient, as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit, low levels of non-performing assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers,” he added.

Mr. Das said both banking and corporate sector balance sheets had been strengthened, engendering a ‘twin balance sheet advantage’ for growth.

“The reach and depth of financial intermediation is being aided by technology and growing digitalisation, which provide new opportunities for growth and financial inclusion,” he added.

Stressing that new risks have necessitated reassessment of global standards on financial sector regulations, governor Das said both regulators and regulated entities in India must stay the course with an unwavering commitment to ensure a stable financial system.

“It has to be remembered that seeds of vulnerability often get sown during good times when risks tend to get overlooked,” he emphasised."
506,The Hindu,Technology to contribute 20-25% of Indian GDP by 2025-26: IT ...,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/technology-to-contribute-20-25-of-indian-gdp-by-2025-26-it-minister-chandrasekhar/article66985108.ece,,"June 19, 2023 02:19 pm | Updated 02:21 pm IST - Washington

The Indian Government has set a goal of making technology 20-25% of the country’s GDP by 2025, India’s IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has told Indian American entrepreneurs and asked them to be part of this story of India.

“Over the last nine years, the digital economy has expanded, diversified and currently there isn’t a slice or space in the tech sector that Indian entrepreneurs, Indian startups are not present in; whether it is semiconductors, micro-electronics, AI, the blockchain and Web3 high-performance computing languages and consumer internet,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his virtual address to the annual Conference of the Global Indian Technology Professionals Association.

“Any part of technology that you look at today, there is significant presence and momentum by Indian startups, Indian enterprises and Indian innovators. Over the last five years, in particular, during and after COVID-19, the Indian innovation economy has grown from the 4-5% in 2014 to 10% today,” he said.

“Our target is that technology and the digital economy would be 20% of the total GDP, which also is growing at about 8%, 7.5% per annum, by 2025-2026. So, 20% of our GDP, which will be about $5 trillion amounts to a trillion dollars and that is the goal that we are working on. That is the mission that Prime Minister Modi’s government is focussed on,” Mr. Chandrasekhar explained.

Describing AI as a kinetic enabler of the digital economy, the Minister said it is a very important and valuable layer on the progress that has been made by the startups and innovation ecosystem over the last several years around the consumer internet and the data economy. The government has branded the artificial intelligence programmes and schemes in the country as India AI.

“India AI in a broad nutshell consists of a partnership between the government on one hand, the large network of academic institutions on the other hand, startups and industry. This partnership today is building out the building blocks of AI for India AI and starting with a collection and curation of one of the most diverse and largest collections of data sets ever available to the research and startup community in India, which is the India Datasets Programme,” he said.

“The other part of the India AI programme is the fact that there are three Centres of Excellence that are going to be funded by the Government of India. In this year’s budget, there’s $150 million that has been set aside to fund these three Centres of Excellence, which in turn will be hubs to a large collection of spokes around academic institutions, universities and colleges and industries that want to engage with these hubs,” the Minister added.

“The areas of these Centres of Excellence are governance. It may turn out to be that they may, in turn, be a mini stack on its own that would make decision-making governance much more granular, much more directed, much more intelligent ranging from the design of schemes to the delivery of schemes,” he said.

“One of the big stellar achievements of Prime Minister Modi's government has been the use of technology, and platforms to really transform governance in India from the dysfunctional, leaky corrupt system of patronage and other forms of dysfunctionality for several decades into what is now a very directed way of reaching out and a trusted directed and trusted way of targeting citizens and making sure their benefits, pensions and other government financial packages are delivered to them without leakage, without any delay and directly to the bank account,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said.

According to the Minister, overall India Stack is gaining a tremendous amount of recognition from countries around the world, and multilateral agencies around the world. This, he said, played a significant role during the Covid pandemic in helping India fight the pandemic, detect disease, and deliver vaccines to the entire population in a seamless and orderly manner, and has therefore acquired a lot of attention, interest, and respect.

The other areas of focus for artificial intelligence are healthcare and languages, he said.

“[In] a country as diverse as India with so many spoken languages and dialects, it’s extremely important that we grow the internet. We will expand the internet [coverage] from 830 million Indians [...] to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025, making India the largest connected nation on the global internet,” he said. The third and fourth element of AI is the data management office, and the creation of AI computing infrastructure, he noted."

The Reserve Bank last week decided not to act on the benchmark interest rate. It retained the rate at 6.5%.

The last time this was raised was in the February 2023 policy meeting from 6.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI meets once in two months.

For 2023-24, the RBI pointed out that domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity. Urban demand remains resilient, with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic, and credit cards outstanding posting double-digit expansion on a year-on-year basis in April. Rural demand is also on a revival path – motorcycle and three-wheeler sales increased at a robust pace (y-o-y) in April, while tractor sales remained subdued.

RBI has retained its estimate for economic growth at 6.5% for FY2023-24. Compared with the estimate released in April, it has raised the forecast for the first half a bit while toning it down for the second half.

Bank of Australia raised the benchmark rate earlier this month and warned of more rate hikes citing persistent inflation. A Reuters report said that the bank removed references to “medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored” which had been part of its statements since July last.

Why is the RBI so focused on inflation? What are the indicators encouraging for the rupee?

India’s economy is firmly out of the throes of the pandemic blues, the higher-than-expected 7.2% GDP growth last year could actually be an ‘underestimate’, and the country is now poised for a decade, if not more, of uninterrupted 6.5%-7% growth, even if no further reforms are undertaken. This was the key message from Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran’s prognosis of the state of the economy, conveyed to industry leaders last week. India, he asserted, could now grow for a longer period of seven to 15 years as China did between 1979 and 2008 without “running into overheating problems” as it did after three-four years of strong growth in recent decades. Among the reasons for his optimism — strong momentum, better macro fundamentals with inflation and trade deficits easing in recent months, and cleaner bank and corporate balance sheets, bolstered by reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digitisation that are spurring formalisation. The CEA’s elaborate elucidation on the economy’s bright prospects can well be seen as a fresh official nudge to the private sector to stop worrying and restart investing. At the same time, his comment that the economy could be on ‘auto-pilot’ mode, may be a hint that the appetite for important pending reforms such as rationalising the GST structure or fixing archaic factor market laws is low, at least till the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

With sectors such as steel and cement seeing higher capacities in action, sections of industry may well start loosening the purse strings soon but a broad-based revival may take longer and needs more actions to buttress the confidence-building. That India has now recovered from the COVID-19 hit on the economy, marked by a 5.8% GDP contraction in 2020-21, is good. But returning to the pre-pandemic trajectory is not enough — remember that growth had slid for seven successive quarters even before the pandemic lockdowns. The economy grew just 3.9% in 2019-20 from 6.5% in the year before, and the quality of the recovery thus far remains uneven. Unless private investment recovers firmly and revs up job creation for millions of youth, demand growth shall not sustain enough to create the virtuous cycle the government is betting on. If India wants to encash the world’s China-plus-one supply chain quest, that intent is not often matched by actions. Misadventures such as high import tariffs and the complex ‘angel tax’ on inbound investments apart, even failing to fix an online service to register a new company does not engender investor confidence. Before the economic engine can be truly on ‘auto pilot’ mode, the government must desist from unnecessary tinkering with its calibrations and create conducive conditions for a smooth and swift, hurdle-free passage for value and job creators."

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to continue to retain the benchmark interest rate at 6.5%. Its estimate for inflation in FY24 is at 5.1% which is lower than the upper tolerance limit of 6% but still higher than the desired midpoint level of 4%.

Given the RBI’s, and other central banks’, hawkish view on rates, where does India’s economy stand? Would the impetus for economic growth have to come from an accommodative fiscal policy?
